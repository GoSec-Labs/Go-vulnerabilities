# **Excessive File System Privileges in Golang Microservices**

## **1. Vulnerability Title**

Excessive File System Privileges in Golang Microservices (also known as "excessive-fs-perms").

This report addresses the security vulnerability characterized by the assignment of excessive file system privileges within Golang-based microservice architectures. While informally referred to as "excessive-fs-perms," this issue is more accurately understood as a pattern of weakness rather than a singular, formally cataloged Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier. Such misconfigurations align closely with Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) such as CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) or CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource). Understanding this distinction is crucial for appropriate risk management and remediation strategies, focusing on systemic improvements rather than searching for a non-existent, specific CVE entry for this general class of vulnerability.

## **2. Severity Rating**

The severity of excessive file system privileges is context-dependent and is best assessed using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1. Based on a general scenario where sensitive files are affected, the vulnerability can range from **MediumðŸŸ¡ to HighðŸŸ **.

For a scenario involving local access leading to high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, a sample CVSS v3.1 Base Score is 7.8 (High).

CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

It is imperative to recognize that this base score reflects inherent characteristics. The actual risk to a specific organization will vary significantly based on environmental factors, such as the sensitivity of the data handled by the Golang microservice, the privileges under which the service operates, and the overall security posture of the deployment environment. A detailed risk classification, including a breakdown of the CVSS metrics, is provided in Section 11.

## **3. Description**

Excessive file system privileges occur when a Golang microservice process, or the files and directories it creates or manages, are granted more permissionsâ€”such as read, write, or executeâ€”than are strictly necessary for their legitimate operational functions. This vulnerability is a manifestation of the broader issue of security misconfiguration, a common problem highlighted in frameworks like the OWASP Top 10.

Often described as a "silent threat," excessive permissions can go unnoticed during development and testing, as they typically do not cause functional errors.However, they significantly expand the application's attack surface. Instead of being the direct cause of a breach, these overly permissive settings often act as enablers, allowing malicious actors who have gained initial access through other means to escalate privileges, access sensitive data, or cause greater damage.

In the context of microservice architectures, where applications are decomposed into smaller, independent services, the impact of misconfigured file permissions can be particularly acute. Each microservice that interacts with the file systemâ€”for logging, configuration management, data storage, or temporary file usageâ€”can become a potential weak point. If one service is compromised due to lax file permissions, it can serve as a stepping stone for attackers to move laterally within the system. Therefore, rigorous adherence to the principle of least privilege is paramount in securing Golang microservices. The vulnerability is less often a flaw within the Go language itself, but rather a consequence of how its powerful I/O capabilities are utilized in conjunction with operating system features, frequently stemming from developer oversight or insecure default configurations.

## **4. Technical Description (for security pros)**

Golang applications, when executed, operate as standard operating system processes. The file system permissions (read, write, execute) associated with files and directories are enforced by the host operating system's kernel. This enforcement is based on the ownership (user and group) of the file system objects and their associated permission bits, commonly represented in Unix-like systems using octal notation (e.g., `$0600`, `$0755$) or symbolic notation (e.g.,`rw-r--r--`).

Golang's standard `os` package provides functions such as `os.OpenFile`, `os.Chmod`, and `os.Mkdir`, which directly translate to system calls that manipulate these file permissions. The security implications arise from how these functions are used:

- **Permission Models:** Unix-like systems employ a permission model based on three categories: owner (the user who created the file), group (users belonging to the file's group), and others (all other users on the system). Each category can be granted read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions.

- **Impact of Process UID/GID:** The User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) under which the Golang microservice process runs are critical. These IDs determine the default ownership of files created by the process and its inherent access rights to existing files. Running a microservice as a privileged user, such as `root` (UID 0), is exceptionally dangerous because any files created might inherit overly broad permissions or be owned by `root`, making them difficult for less privileged processes to manage securely and potentially granting the process unrestricted access to the entire file system.
- **Containerization Context:** In containerized environments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), file permissions are equally important. They apply within the container's isolated file system layers and to any mounted volumes. Excessive permissions inside a container can become a pathway to host compromise if other vulnerabilities, such as a container escape through a kernel exploit, are present, or if host volumes are mounted insecurely with read-write access and overly permissive settings within the container. For instance, a Go process running as `root` inside a container, if it creates a world-writable file on a host-mounted volume, exposes that file to modification by any process on the host that can access that volume path.
    
- **SetUID/SetGID Risks:** While less common for typical stateless microservices, if a Golang binary were compiled and deployed with `setuid` or `setgid` bits set, any file operations performed by this binary would occur with the privileges of the file's owner or group, not the user who executed it. If such a binary performs file operations with overly permissive flags, it could directly lead to privilege escalation. This risk is compounded if standard I/O file descriptors are closed or manipulated, potentially leading to unexpected files being read or written with elevated privileges.

The core technical issue is the potential mismatch between the intended function of a file operation and the permissions granted. A seemingly innocuous coding error, such as using `$0666` when creating a temporary file, combined with a risky operational practice like running the container as `root`, can drastically elevate the actual security risk. This underscores the necessity of a holistic security view that encompasses both development-time coding practices and operational deployment configurations.

## **5. Common Mistakes That Cause This**

Excessive file system privileges in Golang microservices commonly arise from a range of inadvertent errors, insecure defaults, or a lack of security awareness during development and deployment. These mistakes often prioritize functionality or convenience over robust security.

- **Overly Permissive `os.Chmod` or `os.OpenFile` Flags:** A frequent mistake is the direct use of wide-open permission flags when creating or modifying files. For example, using `os.OpenFile("path", flags, 0666)` or `os.Chmod("path", 0777)` grants read and write access (and execute in the case of `$0777`) to the owner, group, and all other users on the system. Such settings are rarely justified, especially for sensitive configuration or data files.
    
- **Ignoring the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** A foundational security principle, PoLP dictates that a process or user should only have the minimum permissions necessary to perform its intended function. Developers may grant broader permissions than needed, either due to a misunderstanding of the requirements or for expediency during development, which then persist into production.
    
- **Overly Permissive Defaults in Systems/Software:** Underlying operating systems, container base images, or even some libraries might have default permission settings (e.g., umask) that are too open. If these are not explicitly overridden or restricted by the application or deployment configuration, newly created files can inherit these insecure permissions.
    
- **Running Microservices as Root or Over-Privileged Users:** This is a particularly prevalent issue in containerized environments. If a Dockerfile does not specify a non-root `USER`, the container and the Golang application within it will run as `root` by default. Files created by a root process are typically owned by root and may have default permissions that are too permissive, or simply being owned by root makes them a higher-value target for modification if write permissions are lax for other users.
    
- **Lack of Granular Access Control for File Resources:** In some cases, permissions are granted on an ad-hoc basis rather than through a structured approach like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) applied to file resources. This can lead to inconsistent and often excessive permissions.
    
- **Manual Permission Granting Errors:** Human error during manual server configuration, deployment script creation, or troubleshooting can lead to incorrect permissions being set.
    
- **Privilege Creep:** Over time, users or service accounts may accumulate more permissions than they initially needed or currently require. This often happens as roles change or temporary access grants are not revoked, and regular audits are not performed to prune these excess rights.

- **Incorrect Umask Settings:** The process's umask (user file creation mode mask) influences the default permissions of newly created files if permissions are not explicitly set during file creation (e.g., by `os.OpenFile`). A permissive umask (e.g., `0000` or `0002`) can lead to world-writable or group-writable files by default.
- **Reusing Permission Groups for Unintended Purposes:** Administrators might add a service account to an existing group to grant access to a resource, without realizing that the group also has permissions to other, unrelated sensitive resources. This effectively grants more access than intended or documented by the group's name.
    
- **Not Validating or Sanitizing File Paths:** While not a direct permission assignment error, vulnerabilities like path traversal can allow an attacker to cause the application to operate on files in unintended locations. If these locations have weaker permission controls, or if the application can create files in arbitrary locations, this can lead to exploitation of excessive permissions.
    

Many of these common mistakes reveal a pattern of "default insecurity," where systems or practices lean towards being more open unless explicitly secured. This underscores the importance of secure defaults, continuous developer education, and robust review processes to proactively identify and correct these misconfigurations.

## **6. Exploitation Goals**

An attacker who identifies and successfully leverages excessive file system privileges in a Golang microservice aims to achieve one or more of the following objectives, typically to escalate their impact or gain further control:

- **Unauthorized Data Access (Confidentiality Breach):** The primary goal is often to read sensitive information. This can include application configuration files containing database credentials, API keys, encryption keys, or other secrets. Attackers may also target files containing personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, intellectual property, or other business-critical information.
    
- **Unauthorized Data Modification or Deletion (Integrity/Availability Breach):** If write permissions are overly permissive, an attacker can alter the content of critical files. This could involve:
    - Modifying configuration files to change application behavior, redirect traffic, or disable security controls.
    - Corrupting application data or databases, leading to incorrect results or application malfunction.
    - Deleting critical application files, logs, or data, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) or hindering forensic investigations.

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If an attacker can write to files that are subsequently executed by the microservice or another process on the system (e.g., scripts, binaries, or configuration files that are interpreted as code), they may achieve arbitrary code execution. This is a severe outcome, often granting the attacker full control over the compromised service or even the host.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Excessive write permissions on certain system files or application files used by higher-privileged processes can be a vector for privilege escalation. For example, if a microservice running as a low-privilege user can write to a script that is executed by a cron job running as `root`, the attacker can inject malicious commands into that script to gain root privileges.
    
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Beyond deleting critical files, an attacker might exploit world-writable directories (e.g., log directories without proper rotation or size limits) to fill up the disk space, causing the microservice or other services on the host to fail. Corrupting essential data files can also lead to service unavailability.
- **Lateral Movement:** In a microservice architecture, compromising one service's files can provide the means to attack other services. This could involve reading shared secrets from configuration files, accessing API keys used for inter-service communication, or placing malicious files in shared volumes that are accessed by other services.
- **Information Gathering:** Even read-only access to an excessive number of files can be valuable to an attacker. They can explore the file system to understand the application's structure, identify technologies in use, discover other potential vulnerabilities, or map out locations of sensitive data. This reconnaissance aids in planning further attacks.

It is important to recognize that excessive file system permissions are frequently not the initial point of compromise but rather a vulnerability that an attacker exploits *after* gaining some level of access to the system. They act as a "force multiplier," significantly increasing the potential damage and scope of an incident. The impact of such a vulnerability can cascade through an interconnected microservice ecosystem, turning a localized breach into a more widespread compromise.

## **7. Affected Components or Files**

The types of files and components within a Golang microservice environment that are at risk due to excessive file system permissions are diverse. Any file system object whose confidentiality, integrity, or availability is critical to the application or system security can be affected. Common examples include:

- **Configuration Files:** These are prime targets as they often contain sensitive information. Examples include `config.json`, `settings.yaml`, `.env` files, or custom configuration formats storing database connection strings, API keys, secret tokens, encryption keys, and other operational parameters.
    
- **Data Files:** Files storing application data, such as SQLite database files, CSVs, XML, JSON data dumps, or any proprietary data formats used by the microservice. This also includes user-uploaded content if not stored with appropriate isolation and permissions.
- **Log Files:** Application logs, system logs, or audit logs can contain sensitive operational details, user activity, IP addresses, session identifiers, or even inadvertently logged PII or credentials if logging is not carefully implemented. Write access to log files could also allow an attacker to tamper with evidence.
    
- **Temporary Files and Directories:** Files created by functions like `os.CreateTemp` or through manual temporary file management. If not created with restrictive permissions (e.g., `$0600`), these can expose transient data or be manipulated.

- **Executable Files/Scripts:** The microservice binary itself, supporting shell scripts, Python scripts, or any other executables used by the application or its operational environment. Write access to these could lead to Trojan horse attacks or direct code execution.
- **Source Code:** Although deploying source code to production environments is generally discouraged, if it is present and has insecure permissions, it could be read to find vulnerabilities or modified to alter application behavior.
- **Sockets (Unix Domain Sockets):** These are file system objects used for Inter-Process Communication (IPC) on the same host. Incorrect permissions on Unix domain sockets can allow unauthorized processes to communicate with the microservice, potentially bypassing authentication or injecting malicious data.
- **Container Image Layers and Build Artifacts:** During the container build process, if `chmod` or `chown` commands in a Dockerfile set overly permissive rights on files within image layers, these permissions persist when the container is run.
- **Mounted Volumes in Containers:** Shared storage between the host and a container, or between multiple containers, is a critical area. Permissions on these volumes, both from the host's perspective and within the container, must be carefully managed. Overly permissive settings can lead to data exposure or allow a compromised container to affect the host or other containers.

The breadth of these components underscores that securing file permissions is not limited to just "data files." It extends to any file system object that the microservice interacts with or depends upon, including those that might not be immediately obvious, such as IPC sockets in a complex microservice deployment. Developers and operators must adopt a comprehensive view of file system interactions to ensure all relevant objects are appropriately secured.

## **8. Vulnerable Code Snippet (Golang)**

Vulnerabilities related to excessive file system permissions in Golang often stem from the incorrect usage of functions within the `os` package, particularly when specifying the permission mode bits. The developer's focus might be solely on the functional aspect of file creation or modification, overlooking the security implications of the chosen permissions.

**Example 1: Overly Permissive File Creation with `os.OpenFile`**

```Go

package main

import (
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // Vulnerable: Creates a file that is world-writable and world-readable
    // The permission 0666 translates to -rw-rw-rw-
    file, err := os.OpenFile("sensitive_data.txt", os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY|os.O_TRUNC, 0666)
    if err!= nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to open file: %s", err)
    }
    defer file.Close()

    _, err = file.WriteString("This is highly sensitive information that anyone on the system can read or modify!\n")
    if err!= nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to write to file: %s", err)
    }
    log.Println("Sensitive data written to sensitive_data.txt")
}
```

- **Explanation:** In this snippet, the `os.OpenFile` function is used with the permission mode `$0666`. This octal value grants read and write permissions to the owner of the file, the group the file belongs to, and all other users on the system. If `sensitive_data.txt` contains confidential information (e.g., API keys, user data), any user or process on the system can read its contents or modify/delete it, leading to potential data breaches or integrity violations.

**Example 2: Insecure Permission Change with `os.Chmod`**

```Go

package main

import (
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    filePath := "/app/config/settings.conf" // Assume this file exists

    // Vulnerable: Changing permissions to be world-readable, world-writable, and world-executable
    // The permission 0777 translates to -rwxrwxrwx
    err := os.Chmod(filePath, 0777)
    if err!= nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to chmod file: %s", err)
    }
    log.Printf("Permissions updated for %s to 0777\n", filePath)
}
```

- **Explanation:** This code uses `os.Chmod` to change the permissions of an existing file, `settings.conf`, to `$0777`. This is an extremely permissive setting, granting read, write, and execute permissions to everyone. For a configuration file, execute permissions are almost never necessary, and world-writable access is highly dangerous as it allows any user to alter the application's configuration, potentially leading to system compromise. This example mirrors the bad practice identified in security guidance where `os.Chmod` is used with overly broad permissions.
    
These examples illustrate how easily such vulnerabilities can be introduced. The Go language provides the necessary tools for file manipulation, but secure usage relies on the developer's understanding of file permission models and adherence to the principle of least privilege. Code reviews, static analysis tools, and developer training are crucial for preventing and detecting these types of insecure coding patterns.

## **9. Detection Steps**

Identifying excessive file system privileges in Golang microservices requires a multi-faceted approach, combining static code analysis, runtime observation, and configuration reviews. No single method is exhaustive.

- **Manual Code Review:**
    - Thoroughly inspect Golang source code for calls to file manipulation functions such as `os.OpenFile`, `os.Chmod`, `os.Mkdir`, `os.MkdirAll`, `os.WriteFile`, and the older `io/ioutil.WriteFile` (now in `os.WriteFile`).
    - Pay close attention to the `perm` argument (mode bits) passed to these functions. Look for values that grant excessive permissions, such as `$0666`, `$0777`, or even `$0644` or `$0755` if applied to highly sensitive files where group/other access is not required.
    - Review how temporary files are handled. While `os.CreateTemp` (and its predecessor `ioutil.TempFile`) generally create files with secure default permissions (typically `$0600`), verify that custom temporary file creation logic also adheres to restrictive permissions.

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**
    - Employ SAST tools that are compatible with Golang and have rulesets to detect insecure file permission settings.
    - Some tools, like DeepSource, have specific checks (e.g., GSC-G302) that flag permissions greater than `$0600` as potentially excessive, unless explicitly justified.
        
    - The `govulncheck` tool, maintained by the Go team, primarily scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies by cross-referencing with the Go vulnerability database. While it may not directly flag custom code permission issues unless they correspond to a CVE in a used library, it's a vital part of dependency security which can sometimes involve file handling.

    - General-purpose SAST tools may also offer capabilities to detect such patterns if properly configured for Golang and relevant security rules (e.g., tools listed by NIST ).
        
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) / Runtime Analysis:**
    - In a controlled test environment, run the Golang microservice and observe the permissions of files and directories it creates or modifies.
    - Use operating system utilities like `ls -l` and `stat` on Linux/macOS, or `icacls` on Windows (if applicable, though Golang microservices are more commonly deployed on Linux), to inspect the actual permissions assigned at runtime.
- **Container Image Scanning:**
    - Utilize tools designed to scan container images (e.g., Docker images) for security misconfigurations. These tools can identify insecure file permissions set within Dockerfiles (e.g., via `RUN chmod...` or `COPY --chown...` with broad permissions) or detect if the container is configured to run with an overly permissive default user (e.g., root).
- **File System Auditing and Monitoring:**
    - Implement regular audits of file permissions on production servers or within running containers, especially for critical application directories, configuration files, data stores, and log directories.

    - Consider using File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) tools to detect unauthorized or unexpected changes to file permissions or content.
    - Continuously monitor for "privilege creep" â€“ the gradual accumulation of excessive permissions over time.
        
- **Configuration Review:**
    - **Dockerfiles:** Scrutinize Dockerfiles for `USER` directives to ensure services run as non-root users. Check for `chmod` or `chown` commands that might apply insecure permissions.

    - **Orchestration Manifests (e.g., Kubernetes):** Review deployment manifests for security context settings like `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, and `fsGroup` to ensure they enforce least privilege for the pod and its volumes.
    - **Operating System Umask:** Verify the default umask for the user account running the microservice to ensure it's restrictive (e.g., `027` or `022`).

Effective detection is not a one-time activity. Due to the potential for "privilege creep" and evolving application code, these detection steps should be integrated into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and ongoing operational security practices. This includes automated checks in CI/CD pipelines and periodic manual reviews.

## **10. Proof of Concept (PoC)**

This Proof of Concept illustrates a plausible scenario where excessive file system permissions in a Golang microservice can be exploited. Actual exploitation requires the attacker to have already gained some level of access to the system or container where the vulnerable service is running.

- Scenario:
    
    A Golang microservice named AuditLogger is responsible for writing audit trail events to a file named /app/logs/audit.log. Due to a coding error, the audit.log file is created with world-writable permissions ($0666). The AuditLogger service itself runs under a dedicated non-privileged user account, appsvc.
    
    Vulnerable Golang code snippet in `AuditLogger`:
    
    ```Go
    
    //...
    logFile, err := os.OpenFile("/app/logs/audit.log", os.O_CREATE|os.O_APPEND|os.O_WRONLY, 0666)
    if err!= nil {
        //... handle error
    }
    //...
    ```
    
- Attacker Vector:
    
    An attacker gains initial access to the server or container hosting the AuditLogger microservice. This initial access could be achieved through an unrelated vulnerability in another application, a compromised SSH key, or any other common intrusion method. The attacker is operating with the privileges of a different, low-privileged user, attackeruser, or has compromised the appsvc account itself through another vector.
    
- **Exploitation Steps (Integrity Violation & Evasion):**
    1. **Discovery:** The attacker, having gained shell access, explores the file system. They execute `ls -l /app/logs/` and observe the permissions for `audit.log`:
        - `rw-rw-rw- 1 appsvc appgroup 10240 Jul 10 10:00 audit.log`
        
        The `-rw-rw-rw-` indicates that any user on the system can read and write to this file.
        
    2. **Tampering:** The attacker decides to tamper with the audit logs to hide their malicious activity or to inject false information. They can use a simple command like:
        
        ```Bash
        
        `echo "10-07-2024 10:05:00 INFO: User 'admin' successfully logged out (tampered entry)" >> /app/logs/audit.log`
        ```
        
        Or, more drastically, they could truncate or delete the log file:
        
        ```Bash
        
        `> /app/logs/audit.log  # Empties the file
        # or
        rm /app/logs/audit.log # Deletes the file (if directory permissions allow)
        ```
        
    3. **Impact:**
        - **Integrity Violation:** The audit trail, a critical component for security monitoring and forensics, is now unreliable. Malicious actions can be hidden, or misleading entries can be injected.
        - **Evasion:** The attacker can cover their tracks, making it harder to detect their presence or subsequent actions.
        - **Potential for Further Exploits:** If the log file is consumed by another automated system that parses it and takes action based on its content (e.g., a SIEM alert trigger), injecting specially crafted log entries might trigger unintended actions in that system.
- Alternative Exploitation (Confidentiality Breach if permissions were $0644 or similar):
    
    If the audit.log file contained sensitive information (e.g., detailed user actions, internal system parameters) and was mistakenly made world-readable (e.g., permissions $0644, -rw-r--r--), the attacker could simply read the file using cat /app/logs/audit.log to exfiltrate this data, even without write access.
    

This PoC demonstrates that excessive file permissions often serve as a secondary vulnerability. The initial system access is a prerequisite, but the misconfigured permissions allow the attacker to escalate their impact, compromise data integrity, evade detection, or gather sensitive information. This underscores the importance of defense-in-depth; even if one security layer is breached, strong file permissions can limit the extent of the damage.

## **11. Risk Classification**

The risk associated with excessive file system privileges in Golang microservices is assessed using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 and categorized by relevant Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs).

**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:**

The CVSS base score quantifies the intrinsic severity of a vulnerability. For a general case of excessive file system privileges where an attacker with local access can read or modify sensitive files, leading to high impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, the score is estimated as follows:

- **Calculated Base Score: 7.8 (High)**
- **Vector String: `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`**

The breakdown of the CVSS base metrics is detailed in the table below:

| **Metric** | **Value** | **Justification for "Excessive FS Perms" (General Case)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attack Vector (AV) | Local (L) | The attacker typically requires prior access to the local file system of the server or container where the Golang microservice's files reside. Exploitation is not typically possible directly from the network without prior compromise. |
| Attack Complexity (AC) | Low (L) | Once local access is achieved, exploiting improperly permissioned files (e.g., reading a world-readable sensitive file or writing to a world-writable configuration file) is generally straightforward and requires no special conditions. |
| Privileges Required (PR) | Low (L) | Exploitation often requires the privileges of a standard, non-administrative user who has access to the file system path. If permissions are set to allow "others" to write, this could even be None, but Low is a common scenario. |
| User Interaction (UI) | None (N) | No interaction from another legitimate user (e.g., tricking them into clicking a link or running a command) is typically required to exploit misconfigured file permissions once the attacker has local access. |
| Scope (S) | Unchanged (U) | The vulnerability usually affects the security scope of the vulnerable component (the microservice and its data) itself. It does not inherently allow the attacker to break out into a different security authority or domain by itself. |
| Confidentiality (C) | High (H) (Context-dependent) | If overly permissive read access is granted to files containing highly sensitive data such as credentials, PII, or encryption keys, the impact on confidentiality is high. This can be Medium or Low for less sensitive files. **1** |
| Integrity (I) | High (H) (Context-dependent) | If overly permissive write access allows modification of critical configuration files, application binaries, or essential data, leading to system compromise, data corruption, or altered behavior, the integrity impact is high. Medium/Low otherwise. |
| Availability (A) | High (H) (Context-dependent) | If deletion or corruption of essential application files, or filling disk space via world-writable log directories, leads to a denial of service for the microservice or related systems, the availability impact is high. Medium/Low otherwise. |

It is crucial to understand that this CVSS base score provides a standardized measure of severity. The actual risk to a specific organization is further influenced by Temporal (e.g., availability of exploit code, patches) and Environmental metrics.**1** Organizations must conduct their own risk assessments, considering the specific assets affected, existing security controls, and potential business impact to determine the true risk level within their environment. This vulnerability class strongly necessitates contextual threat modeling.

**Relevant CWEs:**

This vulnerability class is primarily associated with the following CWEs:

- **CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions:** This weakness occurs when software, during installation or operation, sets file permissions that allow unintended actors to modify those files. This is common when default umask settings are too permissive or when files are explicitly created with overly broad permissions.
- **CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource:** This describes situations where a product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource (like a configuration file or data store) in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

Other related CWEs might include CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) or CWE-275 (Permission Issues).

**Likelihood:**

The likelihood of excessive file system privileges occurring can be high, especially in environments with rapid development cycles, insufficient security training, a lack of automated security checks, or where insecure default configurations are prevalent.

**Impact:**

The potential impact is variable, ranging from minor information disclosure to complete system compromise. This depends heavily on:

- The sensitivity of the data in the affected files.
- The criticality of the files to the application's function or security.
- The privileges of the Golang microservice process itself.
- The overall security architecture of the system.

In microservice environments, the impact can be amplified due to the interconnected nature of services, potentially leading to cascading failures or wider breaches.

## **12. Fix & Patch Guidance**

Addressing excessive file system privileges in Golang microservices involves applying secure coding practices, adhering to the principle of least privilege at the operating system level, and ensuring secure deployment configurations.

**Golang Specific Fixes:**

- **Use Restrictive Permissions with `os.OpenFile`:** When creating files, always explicitly specify the minimum necessary permissions using the `perm` argument.
    - For files intended to be private to the owner (e.g., configuration files, data files, temporary files): Use permission mode `$0600` (owner: read/write; group: none; others: none).
        
        ```Go
        
        // Secure: Creates a file with owner read/write permissions only
        file, err := os.OpenFile("private_config.json", os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY|os.O_TRUNC, 0600)
        if err!= nil {
            // Handle error
        }
        defer file.Close()
        ```
        
    - For executable files or scripts intended to be run only by the owner: Use permission mode `$0700` (owner: read/write/execute; group: none; others: none).
- **Use `os.Chmod` Cautiously and Correctly:** Only use `os.Chmod` when absolutely necessary to change permissions of existing files, and always apply restrictive permissions. For instance, to make a script executable by the owner only, after its creation:
    
    ```Go
    
    err := os.Chmod("myscript.sh", 0700)
    ```
    
    If a file only needs to be readable by the owner, `$0400` is appropriate. Avoid using `os.Chmod` to grant broader permissions than originally set unless there is a well-justified reason and thorough security review.
    
- **Secure Temporary File Creation:** Utilize `os.CreateTemp` (which replaced `io/ioutil.TempFile`) for creating temporary files. This function creates files in an appropriate system temporary directory with secure default permissions, typically `$0600` (owner read/write). Always remember to remove temporary files when they are no longer needed.
    
    ```Go
    
    tmpFile, err := os.CreateTemp("", "myapp-*.tmp")
    if err!= nil {
        // Handle error
    }
    // tmpFile.Name() provides the path; permissions are usually 0600
    defer os.Remove(tmpFile.Name())
    // Use tmpFile
    ```
    

**System-Level and Process Configuration:**

- **Set Appropriate Umask:** While Golang's `os.OpenFile` with an explicit `perm` argument overrides the process's umask for that specific file creation, it's good practice to ensure the Golang microservice process runs with a restrictive umask (e.g., `0027` or `0022`). This provides a safer default if any files are inadvertently created without explicit permissions (though this should be avoided in Go code by always specifying the mode). The umask can be set for the service's execution environment.
- **Validate and Sanitize File Paths:** To prevent path traversal vulnerabilities that could lead an attacker to interact with files in unintended, possibly less secure locations, always validate and sanitize any file paths derived from external input. Use functions like `filepath.Clean` and ensure paths are restricted to expected directories.
    
    ```Go
    
    userInputPath := ".." // Potentially malicious input
    cleanedPath := filepath.Clean(userInputPath)
    // Further checks needed, e.g., ensure cleanedPath is within a base directory
    // if!strings.HasPrefix(cleanedPath, "/safe/basedir/") { /* error */ }
    ```
    

The following table provides general recommendations for file permissions in Golang applications:

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Permission (Octal)** | **Symbolic** | **Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Private Data/Config Files | `$0600` | `rw-------` | Owner: Read/Write. No access for group/others. Maximizes confidentiality and integrity. |
| Private Executable/Script | `$0700` | `rwx------` | Owner: Read/Write/Execute. No access for group/others. For service-owned executables. |
| Data Readable by Service Group | `$0640` | `rw-r-----` | Owner: Read/Write. Group: Read-Only. No access for others. For controlled sharing within a trusted group. |
| Script Executable by Service Group | `$0750` | `rwxr-x---` | Owner: Read/Write/Execute. Group: Read/Execute. No access for others. For controlled sharing. |
| Publicly Readable Static Asset | `$0644` | `rw-r--r--` | Owner: Read/Write. Group/Others: Read-Only. Use with caution, typically for web server assets. |
| Publicly Executable Script | `$0755` | `rwxr-xr-x` | Owner: Read/Write/Execute. Group/Others: Read/Execute. Use with extreme caution and only if essential. |
| Secure Temporary File | `$0600` (default by `os.CreateTemp`) | `rw-------` | Owner: Read/Write. Ensures temporary data is not exposed. |

Fixing this class of vulnerability is primarily about instilling secure coding habits and ensuring developers understand OS permission models. Golang provides the necessary functionalities; the responsibility lies with the developer to use them securely. For systemic issues, changes may extend beyond code to deployment scripts and CI/CD pipeline configurations to enforce secure defaults and perform checks.

## **13. Scope and Impact**

The scope and impact of excessive file system privileges in Golang microservices can be extensive, affecting not only the compromised service but potentially the entire application ecosystem and the business itself.

**Impact on the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability):**

- **Confidentiality:** Overly permissive read access can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. This includes credentials (API keys, database passwords), Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial records, intellectual property, or internal system configurations. Such breaches can have severe regulatory and reputational consequences.
- **Integrity:** If write permissions are too broad, attackers can modify or delete critical data, configuration files, or even the application's executable code. This can lead to:
    - Data corruption and unreliable application behavior.
    - Manipulation of application logic for malicious purposes.
    - Injection of malware or backdoors.
    - Compromise of system integrity, making it untrustworthy.
- **Availability:** Attackers can cause Denial of Service (DoS) by:
    - Deleting essential application files or system libraries.
    - Corrupting data stores, rendering the application unusable.
    - Exhausting disk space by writing large amounts of data to world-writable directories (e.g., log directories without proper controls).

**Microservice Architecture Implications:**

The distributed and interconnected nature of microservices can amplify the impact:

- **Lateral Movement:** A compromised microservice, due to lax file permissions allowing access to shared secrets or service account tokens, can become a pivot point for an attacker to move laterally across the network, targeting other services within the cluster.
    
- **Wider Blast Radius:** In a microservice architecture, "every node is a possible entry point for an exploit". A vulnerability in one service, such as excessive file permissions, can have a cascading effect, potentially compromising multiple other services or even the entire application if shared resources (like insecurely permissioned volumes or configuration services) are involved.

**Containerized vs. Non-Containerized Environments:**

- **Containers:**
    - The risk is significantly amplified if the Golang microservice runs as the `root` user within the container. This grants the process extensive privileges within the container's namespace.
        
    - If combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., a kernel exploit allowing container escape), excessive permissions within the container could facilitate compromise of the underlying host.
    - Insecurely configured volume mounts (e.g., host paths mounted with read-write access and overly permissive in-container permissions) can directly expose host files to modification or allow inter-container attacks if volumes are shared.
        
- **Non-Containers (VMs/Bare Metal):**
    - The impact is typically contained within the security context of the user account running the Golang service.
    - However, if this user account itself has excessive system-wide privileges, or if critical system files have insecure permissions accessible by this user, the entire host can still be compromised.
        
**Business Impact:**

The business ramifications of exploiting excessive file system privileges can be severe:

- **Reputational Damage:** Data breaches or service disruptions erode customer trust and damage the organization's brand.
- **Financial Loss:** Costs associated with incident response, forensic investigation, system recovery, customer notification, potential fines, and lost business.
- **Legal and Regulatory Penalties:** Non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA) due to PII exposure can result in substantial fines and legal action.
- **Loss of Customer Trust:** Customers may lose confidence in the organization's ability to protect their data, leading to churn.
- **Operational Disruption:** Downtime or malfunction of critical services can halt business operations.

Excessive file permissions effectively lower the barrier for attackers. What might otherwise be a contained, low-impact security incident can rapidly escalate into a major breach if critical files and directories are not adequately protected. This highlights that fundamental security hygiene, such as enforcing proper file permissions, is a cornerstone of overall system resilience.

## **14. Remediation Recommendation**

A comprehensive remediation strategy for excessive file system privileges in Golang microservices involves a combination of secure coding practices, robust operational configurations, continuous monitoring, and developer education. The overarching principle is adherence to the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).

1. Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):

This is the most critical remediation step. Golang processes, user accounts, and files/directories should only be granted the absolute minimum permissions required for their legitimate functions.2 Regularly review and revoke any unnecessary permissions.

**2. Code-Level Practices (Golang):**

- **Explicit and Restrictive Permissions:** When creating files or directories using functions like `os.OpenFile`, `os.Mkdir`, or `os.MkdirAll`, always explicitly specify the most restrictive permission mode that allows the application to function. For instance, use `$0600` for private data files and `$0700` for private executables/scripts.
- **Secure Temporary File Handling:** Use `os.CreateTemp` for creating temporary files, as it defaults to secure permissions (typically `$0600`). Ensure temporary files are promptly deleted after use.
    
- **Input Validation and Path Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize any file paths derived from user input or external sources to prevent path traversal attacks. Use `filepath.Clean` and ensure paths are constrained to intended base directories.

**3. Operational Practices (Containers & Microservices):**

- **Run as Non-Root User:** This is paramount in containerized environments. Configure Dockerfiles to use the `USER` directive to switch to a non-root user before executing the Golang application. In Kubernetes, define `securityContext` in pod specifications with `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, and `fsGroup` set to non-root, non-zero values.
    
- **Read-Only Root Filesystem:** Whenever feasible, configure containers to run with a read-only root filesystem (e.g., `-read-only` flag in Docker run, or `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` in Kubernetes `securityContext`). Writable data should be stored in dedicated, properly permissioned volumes.
    
- **Secure Volume Mounts:** Carefully manage permissions on mounted volumes. Ensure that the permissions set on the host, within the container, and by the `fsGroup` (in Kubernetes) are as restrictive as possible while still allowing functionality. Avoid sharing volumes unnecessarily between containers.
- **Avoid `-privileged` Flag:** Do not run containers with the `-privileged` flag unless it is absolutely unavoidable and the security implications are fully understood and mitigated. This flag grants the container extensive host privileges.
    
- **Minimize Container Capabilities:** Drop all unnecessary Linux capabilities from containers. Start with a minimal set and only add capabilities that are explicitly required by the application.
- **Avoid Excessive `chmod` in Dockerfiles:** Refrain from using broad `chmod` commands (e.g., `RUN chmod -R 777 /some/path`) within Dockerfiles. Set precise ownership and permissions during the image build process.

**4. System-Level Configuration:**

- **Restrictive Umask:** Ensure that the default umask for the environment where the Golang microservice runs is restrictive (e.g., `0027` or `0022`). This provides a safer baseline for file creation if explicit permissions are ever missed (though explicit permissions in code are preferred).

**5. Access Control Strategies:**

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** For file resources that require access by multiple users or services (e.g., shared data stores, user-uploaded content directories), implement RBAC or similar fine-grained access control mechanisms rather than relying on broad Unix permissions.
    
- **Policy Decision Points (PDPs):** In complex microservice environments, consider using standalone PDPs (e.g., Open Policy Agent) to manage and enforce authorization policies for resource access, including file system interactions, in a centralized and consistent manner.

**6. Auditing, Monitoring, and Testing:**

- **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit file and directory permissions in all environments (development, testing, production) to identify and correct any deviations from PoLP.
    
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM tools for critical configuration files, application binaries, and sensitive data directories to detect unauthorized modifications or permission changes.
- **Integrate Security Testing into CI/CD:**
    - Use SAST tools to scan Golang code for insecure file permission settings and other vulnerabilities during development and in CI pipelines.
    - Employ DAST tools and perform runtime checks in test environments to validate actual file permissions.
    - Scan container images for security misconfigurations, including permission issues.

**7. Developer Training and Awareness:**

- Educate developers on secure file handling practices, the Principle of Least Privilege, Unix/Linux permission models, and the specific risks associated with excessive permissions in Golang applications and containerized environments.

Remediation of excessive file system privileges is not merely a one-time code fix. It requires a cultural shift towards a DevSecOps mindset, integrating security into every phase of the software development lifecycle, from design and coding to deployment and operations. By adopting these comprehensive recommendations, organizations can significantly reduce their attack surface and enhance the overall security posture of their Golang microservices.

## **15. Summary**

Excessive file system privileges in Golang microservices represent a critical security misconfiguration where applications, or the files and directories they interact with, are granted more access rights (read, write, execute) than functionally necessary. This vulnerability, often referred to informally as "excessive-fs-perms," is not typically a flaw within the Go language itself but arises from developer oversight, insecure default settings in the operating environment or container images, or operational misconfigurations.

The primary risks associated with this vulnerability include unauthorized access to sensitive data (leading to confidentiality breaches), unauthorized modification or deletion of critical files (impacting integrity and availability), and potential pathways for privilege escalation or lateral movement within a system.**4** Excessive permissions often act as an enabler, amplifying the impact of other security weaknesses.

The cornerstone of preventing and mitigating this vulnerability is the consistent application of the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).**4** This means that every process, user, and file system object should possess only the bare minimum permissions required for its intended purpose.

A holistic approach is essential for remediation. This encompasses:

- **Secure Coding Practices in Golang:** Explicitly setting restrictive permissions (e.g., `$0600` for private files) during file creation and modification, using secure methods for temporary file handling like `os.CreateTemp`, and validating file paths.
- **Secure Operational and Containerization Practices:** Running microservices as non-root users, utilizing read-only root filesystems for containers where possible, carefully configuring volume permissions, and avoiding overly permissive container settings like the `-privileged` flag.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Auditing:** Regularly auditing file permissions, employing SAST/DAST tools within CI/CD pipelines, and using file integrity monitoring.
- **Developer Education:** Ensuring that development teams are aware of the risks and best practices for secure file handling.

By proactively assessing Golang microservice deployments for excessive file system privileges and implementing robust remediation strategies, organizations can significantly strengthen their security posture, reduce their attack surface, and protect critical assets from potential compromise. Mastering Golang's file permission APIs and adhering to secure file handling practices are key to enhancing application security.
