# Report on Golang Vulnerability: Cryptographically Insecure Random Numbers (insecure-rand)

## Vulnerability Title

Cryptographically Insecure Random Numbers (e.g., math/rand), short insecure-rand

## Severity Rating

The use of cryptographically insecure random numbers in security-sensitive contexts is generally classified as a **HighðŸŸ ** or even **CriticalðŸ”´** severity vulnerability. The potential for severe impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability warrants immediate attention and robust remediation.

### CVSS v3.1 Assessment

A notable instance, CVE-2024-21495, which involved the misuse of `math/rand` in the `github.com/greenpau/caddy-security` plugin, received a **9.8 Critical** CVSS v3.1 base score from NVD (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). However, Snyk rated the same vulnerability as **6.5 Medium**. This difference in scoring for an identical vulnerability highlights that while the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides a standardized framework, its interpretation and the resulting severity rating can vary. This variation often depends on the specific context of the affected application and the perceived practical likelihood or ease of exploitation in a real-world scenario. A high base score indicates a significant potential for severe, widespread impact, but how security teams prioritize it might be influenced by specific environmental factors, the nature of the affected component within the broader application, or the difficulty of chaining attacks. Organizations are therefore encouraged to conduct their own risk assessments, taking into account their unique threat models and deployment environments, rather than relying solely on external scores.

General insecure randomness generation vulnerabilities typically exhibit an average CVSS score ranging from **6 to 9 out of 10**, indicating a consistent potential for sensitive data compromise and unauthorized system access. For comparison, critical severity flaws such as SQL Injection typically receive CVSS 3.1 ratings between 9.0 and 10.0, while high severity flaws like XML External Entity (XXE) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) are typically rated between 7.0 and 8.9. This contextualization underscores the significant potential for severe impact resulting from insecure randomness.

### Impact Metrics (based on CVSS)

The potential consequences of exploiting cryptographically insecure random numbers are substantial across several security domains:

- **Confidentiality (C): High** â€“ An attacker can gain unauthorized access to critical files or sensitive information, including user credentials, personal data, or encryption keys.
- **Integrity (I): High** â€“ An attacker can modify system components, leading to data tampering, unauthorized state changes, or compromising the trustworthiness and accuracy of information.
- **Availability (A): High** â€“ An attacker can disrupt or prevent legitimate access to services or data, potentially causing a denial of service.
- **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)** â€“ The vulnerability can often be exploited remotely over a network without requiring physical access.
- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)** â€“ Exploiting this vulnerability is relatively easy, particularly if predictable seeds are employed.
- **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)** â€“ No specific account or permissions are typically required for exploitation. In some scenarios, **Low (L)** privileges might be sufficient if the attacker has some initial, low-level access.
- **User Interaction (UI): None (N)** â€“ No user action is required for the attack to succeed.
- **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)** â€“ The vulnerability usually does not allow an attacker to bypass security boundaries and control resources beyond the immediate vulnerable component.

This structured breakdown clarifies the various factors contributing to the vulnerability's high severity, aiding security professionals in risk prioritization and communication.

## Description

This vulnerability, commonly known as "Insecure Randomness" , manifests when an application utilizes a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) that lacks the necessary cryptographic strength for security-sensitive operations. In the context of Golang, this frequently involves the `math/rand` package.

Unlike Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generators (CSPRNGs) such as `crypto/rand`, the `math/rand` package produces numbers that are deterministic and, critically, predictable, especially if the initial seed value is known or can be easily guessed. This inherent predictability enables malicious actors to anticipate or reproduce "random" values. Such capabilities can lead to the bypass of security controls, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or even a full system compromise.

The vulnerability becomes particularly critical in scenarios where randomness is fundamental to security. This includes, but is not limited to, the generation of session IDs, authentication tokens, password reset tokens, encryption keys, nonces (numbers used once), or other security-sensitive identifiers. If these values can be predicted by an attacker, they can impersonate legitimate users, decrypt confidential data, or gain unauthorized access to critical system functionalities, leading to severe security breaches.

## Technical Description (for Security Professionals)

### Understanding Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)

Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs) are algorithmic constructs that generate sequences of numbers. While these sequences exhibit characteristics that make them appear random, they are fundamentally deterministic. Their operation begins with an initial "seed" value, and all subsequent numbers in the sequence are produced through a series of mathematical computations applied to the preceding state.

The primary design objective of PRNGs is to create statistically random sequences suitable for applications where true unpredictability is not a strict requirement. This includes domains such as scientific simulations, game development, or statistical modeling, where factors like performance and the ability to reproduce a specific sequence (for debugging or analysis) might be prioritized. A defining characteristic of PRNGs is that if both the initial seed and the underlying algorithm are known, the entire sequence of generated numbers can be precisely reproduced. This inherent predictability renders them fundamentally unsuitable for any security-critical context where the unpredictability of the output is paramount for maintaining security.

### Understanding Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generators (CSPRNGs)

Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generators (CSPRNGs) represent a specialized and more stringent class of PRNGs, specifically engineered to satisfy the rigorous demands of cryptographic applications. While every CSPRNG is, by definition, a PRNG, the converse is not true. Their core objective is to achieve a level of **unpredictability** and **indistinguishability from true randomness** that can withstand even sophisticated attacks, even if the adversary possesses full knowledge of the algorithm and all past outputs.

CSPRNGs attain this high level of security by continuously drawing upon high-entropy sources. These sources typically include hardware random number generators or environmental noise, such as disk I/O timings, network event timings, or even user input like mouse movements. This constant infusion of unpredictability ensures that the generated numbers are resilient against cryptanalytic attacks. CSPRNGs are indispensable for applications that demand strong security guarantees, including the generation of cryptographic keys, nonces, initialization vectors (IVs), session tokens, and other security-sensitive identifiers. Cryptographic protocols and security mechanisms would fail catastrophically if this fundamental unpredictability were compromised.

### The `math/rand` Package: Design, Limitations, and Predictability

The `math/rand` package in Go functions as a standard Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) and is primarily intended for applications that do not require cryptographic strength. While efficient for general-purpose use, its design introduces significant security limitations when it is mistakenly employed in contexts demanding true unpredictability.

A critical flaw in `math/rand`'s design is its default behavior of using a predictable seed value. This seed is often derived from the current system time, for example, via `time.Now().UnixNano()`. This approach makes the generated sequence of "random" numbers easily reproducible. If an attacker can determine or closely approximate the time an application started or when a specific function was invoked, they can re-seed their own `math/rand` instance with the same value. This allows them to generate the exact same sequence of numbers, effectively predicting future outputs. Such predictability can be leveraged to compromise system security.

Furthermore, `math/rand` does not directly access system-level entropy sources, unlike CSPRNGs. It relies solely on its initial fixed or manually set seed, which typically does not provide sufficient entropy for security-critical tasks. This lack of true randomness makes its output vulnerable to statistical analysis and prediction by an adversary.

In older versions of Go, the global functions within `math/rand` were protected by a global mutex. While intended to ensure thread safety, this mutex could become a performance bottleneck in highly concurrent applications. More importantly, concurrent access without proper synchronization (even if not using the global mutex) can lead to unpredictable behavior. However, this is distinct from true cryptographic randomness and can still be exploited by an attacker who understands the timing and state changes.

A significant software engineering concern with the original `math/rand` package was the inclusion of a `Read` function, which shared a similar name with `crypto/rand.Read`. This naming similarity could easily mislead developers into inadvertently using `math/rand.Read` for generating cryptographic secrets, a mistake with potentially disastrous consequences if used for sensitive key material. Although `math/rand.Read` could not be entirely removed from `v1` due to compatibility constraints, it was deprecated in Go 1.20 in favor of `crypto/rand`.

The `math/rand` package's default behavior of producing a deterministic sequence unless explicitly seeded (and even then, with a predictable seed like `time.Now().UnixNano()`) represents a fundamental design choice that prioritizes reproducibility (useful for testing and simulation) over unpredictability (essential for security). This is a dangerous default for developers who may not fully grasp this crucial distinction. The common practice of demonstrating `rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())` in introductory tutorials  further exacerbates the problem, as it inadvertently instills a false sense of security. This situation underscores a pedagogical challenge as much as a library design issue, leading to widespread insecure implementations in real-world applications. Discussions within the Go community, such as `golang/go/issues/11871` , explicitly highlight this "dangerous default behavior" and acknowledge that merely documenting it has proven insufficient to prevent misuse.

The availability of both `math/rand` (which is generally faster) and `crypto/rand` (which is slower but cryptographically secure) presents a choice for developers. A common pitfall is to prioritize performance in contexts where security should be paramount, leading to the inappropriate use of `math/rand` for critical functions. `crypto/rand` is inherently slower because it gathers true entropy from system-level sources, a more resource-intensive operation compared to the deterministic algorithms employed by `math/rand`. Developers, often under pressure to optimize application performance, might inadvertently select `math/rand` without fully realizing the severe security implications of using a predictable PRNG for sensitive data. This situation illustrates a common dilemma in software engineering where non-functional requirements, such as performance, can inadvertently compromise critical functional requirements, such as security. The solution is not to compromise the security of `crypto/rand` for speed, but rather to educate developers on when `math/rand` is inappropriate and to encourage the adoption of secure-by-default abstractions for all security-related operations.

### The `crypto/rand` Package: The Secure Alternative

The `crypto/rand` package is an integral part of Go's standard library, providing mechanisms for generating cryptographically secure random numbers. It is the unequivocally recommended choice for any application requiring strong, unpredictable randomness for security purposes.

`crypto/rand` achieves its high level of security by leveraging the underlying operating system's high-entropy sources. On Linux, FreeBSD, Dragonfly, and Solaris, it utilizes `getrandom(2)`. For older Linux systems (pre-3.17), it opens `/dev/urandom`. On macOS, iOS, and OpenBSD, it employs `arc4random_buf(3)`, and on Windows, it uses the `ProcessPrng` API. This direct access to robust system entropy is the fundamental distinction that sets `crypto/rand` apart from `math/rand`.

The core functionality is provided by `rand.Read(bbyte)`, which fills a byte slice `b` with cryptographically secure random bytes. This function is designed to be safe for concurrent use and is documented to reliably succeed on most modern systems, rarely returning an error.

For specific security-sensitive use cases, `crypto/rand` offers specialized functions:

- `crypto/rand.Text()` is available for generating secure tokens or arbitrary secret strings. This function is specifically tailored for secret strings, tokens, and passwords, guaranteeing at least 128 bits of randomness to thwart brute-force guessing attacks and minimize the likelihood of collisions.
- `crypto/rand.Prime()` is provided for generating cryptographically strong prime numbers, essential for certain cryptographic algorithms.
- For generating large, uniform random integers within a specified range, often required for cryptographic operations involving large numbers, `crypto/rand.Int(rand.Reader, max *big.Int)` can be utilized.

Adherence to best practices is crucial when using `crypto/rand`. Developers should consistently employ `crypto/rand` for all security-critical operations, implement robust error handling (even though `Read` rarely produces errors), and stay updated with the latest Go releases to benefit from continuous security improvements and new features.

### Go 1.22 `math/rand/v2` Improvements and Continued Recommendations

Go 1.22 introduced `math/rand/v2`, bringing several notable improvements over the original `math/rand` package. These changes were aimed at modernizing the underlying PRNG algorithms, enhancing performance, and refining the API design for its intended non-cryptographic use cases.

Key improvements include the replacement of the older, less efficient generator with more modern algorithms: PCG and ChaCha8. Significantly, ChaCha8 was made the default generator for global functions within `math/rand/v2`. As ChaCha8 is a stream cipher, its accidental misuse for cryptographic contexts is considerably *less catastrophic* than would have been the case with the original `math/rand`. Additionally, API enhancements were introduced, such as revising the `Source` interface to replace `Int63` with `Uint64`, which aligns better with the outputs of modern generators. The top-level `Seed` function was also removed, meaning global functions are now auto-seeded.

Despite these improvements in `math/rand/v2`, it is imperative to understand that it remains a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) designed for simulations and non-cryptographic applications. Programs are still **strongly encouraged** to use `crypto/rand` for generating cryptographic secrets. This continued emphasis highlights that while `math/rand/v2` is more robust for its intended purpose, it does not replace the need for `crypto/rand` when high entropy and cryptographic security are critical for deriving keys, tokens, or other sensitive information.

## Common Mistakes That Cause This

The prevalence of insecure random number generation vulnerabilities in Golang applications often stems from several common programming mistakes and misunderstandings:

- **Inappropriate Use of `math/rand` for Security-Critical Functions:** Developers frequently use `math/rand` for generating values that require cryptographic strength, such as session identifiers, authentication tokens, password reset tokens, or encryption keys. This is the most direct cause of the vulnerability.
- **Predictable Seeding of `math/rand`:** Even when developers attempt to "seed" `math/rand` to make it appear more random, they often use predictable values like the current system timestamp (e.g., `time.Now().UnixNano()`). This approach provides a false sense of security, as an attacker can easily guess or approximate the seed, thereby predicting the entire sequence of numbers.
- **Lack of Fundamental Understanding of PRNG vs. CSPRNG:** A significant portion of the problem arises from developers not fully understanding the fundamental differences between a general-purpose PRNG (`math/rand`) and a cryptographically secure PRNG (`crypto/rand`). They may mistakenly believe that "random" is sufficient for all purposes.
- **Prioritizing Performance Over Security:** `math/rand` is generally faster than `crypto/rand` because it does not incur the overhead of gathering entropy from the operating system. Developers, especially under performance optimization pressures, might inadvertently choose `math/rand` for speed without realizing the severe security implications for sensitive data.
- **Failure to Seed `math/rand` at All:** In some cases, developers may use `math/rand` functions without any explicit seeding. In older Go versions, this would result in the same deterministic sequence of numbers being generated every time the program runs, making the output trivially predictable.
- **Misleading Naming Conventions:** The presence of a `Read` function in the original `math/rand` package, similar in name to `crypto/rand.Read`, could lead to accidental misuse for cryptographic purposes.
- **Insufficient Code Review and Static Analysis:** A lack of rigorous code review processes or the absence of automated static analysis tools configured to detect `math/rand` usage in security-critical contexts allows these vulnerabilities to persist in the codebase.

## Exploitation Goals

Attackers exploiting insecure random number generation primarily aim to predict or manipulate values that are intended to be unpredictable, thereby achieving various malicious objectives:

- **Predicting Generated Values:** The primary goal is to predict values such as session IDs, authentication tokens, nonces, password reset tokens, or encryption keys.
- **Bypassing Authentication Mechanisms:** By predicting session IDs, attackers can hijack user sessions. Predictable password reset tokens or multi-factor authentication (MFA) secrets can allow attackers to reset passwords or bypass MFA, leading to unauthorized account access or OAuth replay attacks.
- **Accessing Sensitive Data:** If encryption keys or initialization vectors (IVs) are generated insecurely, attackers can decrypt sensitive information, leading to data breaches or unauthorized access to files and databases.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining unauthorized access through predictable values can sometimes be leveraged to escalate privileges within a system.
- **System Integrity Compromise:** Predictable nonces or IVs can weaken cryptographic protocols, potentially enabling data tampering or manipulation by an attacker.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If random numbers are used in resource allocation, process IDs, or other critical system operations, their predictability could be exploited to cause resource exhaustion, conflicts, or system crashes, leading to a denial of service.

## Affected Components or Files

The vulnerability of cryptographically insecure random numbers can impact various components and files within a Go application, particularly those responsible for generating security-sensitive values:

- **Authentication and Session Management Modules:** Components handling user sessions, password resets, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and API key generation are critically affected if they rely on `math/rand` for creating tokens, nonces, or secrets.
- **Cryptographic Operations:** Any part of the application involved in generating cryptographic keys, initialization vectors (IVs), or nonces will be vulnerable if `math/rand` is used instead of `crypto/rand`.
- **Temporary File Naming:** If `math/rand` is used to generate unique names for temporary files, these names might be predictable, potentially leading to race conditions or symlink attacks if combined with other vulnerabilities.
- **General Security-Critical String/Number Generation:** Any other part of the application that generates unique identifiers, random delays, or other values intended to be unpredictable for security purposes, but uses `math/rand`, is at risk.
- **Specific Go Packages:** The primary package involved is `math/rand`.
- **Application Source Files:** Specific examples from research indicate that files like `internal/internal.go` and `plugins/inputs/example/example.go` have been flagged for using `math/rand` where `crypto/rand` would be more appropriate. This suggests that the vulnerability can appear in various parts of an application's codebase.

## Vulnerable Code Snippet

The following Go code snippet demonstrates the insecure use of `math/rand` for generating a security-sensitive value, such as a password reset token:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time" // Used for seeding, which is predictable
)

// generateInsecureToken generates a predictable "random" token.
func generateInsecureToken() string {
	// Insecure: Seeding with current time makes the sequence predictable.
	// If an attacker can guess the approximate time this function is called,
	// they can reproduce the sequence.
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) 
	
	// Generates a 6-digit number. The predictability of the seed combined with
	// a small output range makes this highly vulnerable to brute-force.
	token := fmt.Sprintf("%06d", rand.Intn(1000000)) 
	return token
}

func main() {
	// Example usage in a hypothetical password reset scenario
	fmt.Println("Generated insecure token:", generateInsecureToken())
	fmt.Println("Generated insecure token:", generateInsecureToken()) // Might be different due to nanosecond timing, but still predictable
}
```

In this example, `rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())` is used to initialize the pseudo-random number generator. While `time.Now().UnixNano()` provides a unique seed for each call, an attacker can often guess the approximate time the function was invoked. By brute-forcing timestamps around that period, they can reproduce the sequence of "random" numbers generated by `math/rand`. The subsequent call to `rand.Intn(1000000)` then generates a 6-digit number, which, when combined with the predictable seed, becomes susceptible to brute-force attacks.

### Compliant Code Example

To generate a cryptographically secure token, the `crypto/rand` package should be used:

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/rand"
	"encoding/base64" // For encoding random bytes into a string
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

// generateSecureToken generates a cryptographically secure random token.
func generateSecureToken(length int) (string, error) {
	// crypto/rand.Read fills the byte slice with cryptographically secure random bytes.
	// It draws from the operating system's entropy source, making it unpredictable.
	b := make(byte, length)
	_, err := rand.Read(b)
	if err!= nil {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to read secure random bytes: %w", err)
	}

	// Encode the random bytes into a URL-safe base64 string.
	// This ensures the token is suitable for use in URLs and is sufficiently long.
	return base64.URLEncoding.EncodeToString(b), nil
}

func main() {
	// Example usage for a password reset token requiring 32 bytes of entropy
	token, err := generateSecureToken(32) // Request 32 bytes of randomness
	if err!= nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Generated secure token:", token)

	// For simple random strings suitable for security contexts (e.g., tokens),
	// crypto/rand.Text() can also be used directly.
	// It guarantees at least 128 bits of randomness.
	secureString := rand.Text()
	fmt.Println("Generated secure string (crypto/rand.Text):", secureString)
}
```

This compliant example utilizes `crypto/rand.Read()` to generate truly unpredictable random bytes, which are then encoded into a secure string. Alternatively, `crypto/rand.Text()` provides a convenient way to generate cryptographically random strings specifically for tokens, passwords, or other secrets. These methods ensure that the generated values are resilient against prediction and brute-force attacks.

## Detection Steps

Detecting the use of cryptographically insecure random numbers in Golang applications involves a combination of automated and manual analysis techniques:

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

SAST tools are highly effective for identifying insecure random number generation by analyzing source code without execution.

- **Gosec:** This is a popular Go security linter. The `G404` rule specifically targets "Insecure random number source (rand)" and maps to CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG). Integrating Gosec into CI/CD pipelines can automate the detection of `math/rand` usage in production code.
- **Semgrep:** Implementing Semgrep in the CI/CD pipeline, specifically using the `math-random-used` rule, can effectively catch instances where `math/rand` is employed.
- **Commercial SAST Tools:** Many commercial SAST solutions, such as SonarQube, CodeSonar, Snyk, Datadog Code Security, and Aikido SAST, offer Go language support and include rules to detect insecure random number generation. These tools can be integrated into IDEs or CI/CD pipelines to provide early feedback.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scanning `go.mod` and `go.sum` files for known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies can identify libraries that might misuse `math/rand`. For example, CVE-2024-21495 affected `github.com/greenpau/caddy-security` due to this issue.

### Manual Code Review

Manual review remains a crucial step for identifying subtle misuses that automated tools might miss.

- **Search for Imports:** Start by searching the codebase for `import "math/rand"`. This identifies all files potentially using the insecure package.
- **Analyze Usage Context:** For every instance of `math/rand`, analyze the context in which its functions (e.g., `rand.Seed()`, `rand.Int()`, `rand.Intn()`, `rand.Float64()`) are called. Determine if the generated numbers are used for any security-sensitive purpose (e.g., authentication, authorization, cryptography, unique identifiers for sensitive data).
- **Verify `crypto/rand` Usage:** Confirm that `crypto/rand` is consistently used for all security-critical random number generation. Look for `import "crypto/rand"` and calls to `rand.Read()` or `rand.Text()`.

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

While DAST tools primarily perform black-box testing on running applications and do not directly scan source code, they might indirectly detect symptoms of insecure randomness. For instance, DAST could identify predictable session IDs or weak tokens by observing application behavior and responses.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker could exploit the use of `math/rand` with a time-based seed to predict a password reset token.

**Scenario:** A hypothetical web application implements a password reset functionality. When a user requests a password reset, the application generates a 6-digit numeric token using Go's `math/rand` package, seeded with `time.Now().UnixNano()`, and sends it to the user's email.

**Vulnerable Application (Conceptual Server-Side Logic):**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
	"net/http"
	"strconv"
)

// generateInsecureToken generates a predictable "random" token.
func generateInsecureToken() string {
	// Insecure: Seeding with current time makes the sequence predictable.
	// If an attacker can guess the approximate time this function is called,
	// they can reproduce the sequence.
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()) 
	
	// Generates a 6-digit number. The predictability of the seed combined with
	// a small output range makes this highly vulnerable to brute-force.
	token := fmt.Sprintf("%06d", rand.Intn(1000000)) 
	return token
}

// simulateSendEmail would send the token to the user's email
func simulateSendEmail(email, token string) {
	fmt.Printf(" Sending token %s to %s\n", token, email)
	// In a real application, this would interact with an email service
}

func resetPasswordHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	email := r.URL.Query().Get("email")
	if email == "" {
		http.Error(w, "Email required", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	token := generateInsecureToken()
	// In a real app, token would be stored with user and sent via email
	simulateSendEmail(email, token)
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Password reset request processed for %s. Check your email.\n", email)
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/reset-password", resetPasswordHandler)
	fmt.Println("Vulnerable server listening on :8080")
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

**Attacker Steps:**

1. **Observe Token Generation:** The attacker, knowing the target's email (e.g., `victim@example.com`), initiates a password reset request for that user. They might observe the approximate time the request was made or the email was sent.
    - *Attacker Action:* `GET http://localhost:8080/reset-password?email=victim@example.com`
    - *Server Response (and simulated email):* `Sending token 123456 to victim@example.com` (attacker notes the token `123456` and the time `T`)
2. **Guess Seed (Brute-Force):** The attacker knows the token is a 6-digit number and that `math/rand` is seeded with `time.Now().UnixNano()`. They can then write a script to brute-force `UnixNano()` values around the observed time `T`. Since `UnixNano()` is a large number, the attacker would typically focus on a small window (e.g., +/- a few seconds or milliseconds) around the observed time.
3. **Reproduce Sequence and Predict Next Token:** Once the attacker's script finds a `seed_candidate` that, when used to initialize `math/rand`, produces the *observed token* (`123456`), they have effectively identified the internal state of the server's PRNG at that specific moment. From this point, the attacker can simply generate the *next* number in the sequence using the same `math/rand` instance. This next number will be the token the server would generate if the victim requested *another* password reset token immediately after the first.

**Attacker Script (Conceptual Python Example):**

Python

```python
import requests
import time
import random

TARGET_URL = "http://localhost:8080/reset-password"
TARGET_EMAIL = "victim@example.com"

def generate_insecure_token_py(seed_nano):
    """Replicates Go's math/rand.Intn(1000000) behavior with a given seed."""
    random.seed(seed_nano)
    return f"{random.randint(0, 999999):06d}"

def exploit_insecure_rand():
    print(f"[*] Requesting initial password reset for {TARGET_EMAIL}...")
    # Simulate the victim or attacker requesting the first token
    start_time_ns = time.time_ns() # Capture approximate time of request
    response = requests.get(f"{TARGET_URL}?email={TARGET_EMAIL}")
    print(f"[*] Server response: {response.text.strip()}")
    print(f"[*] Note the approximate time of this request: {start_time_ns} ns")

    # --- ATTACKER'S PREDICTION PHASE ---
    # In a real attack, the attacker would have observed a token (e.g., from a leaked email or by monitoring)
    # and the approximate time it was generated. For this PoC, we'll simulate finding the "correct" seed
    # by brute-forcing around the time we just made the request.

    # Assume we observed a token, and now we try to find the seed that generated it.
    # Let's say the observed token was "123456" (hypothetical, from the server's output)
    # We'll search a window of +/- 5 seconds around the recorded start_time_ns.
    # The granularity of the search (e.g., 1000 for microseconds) depends on system clock resolution.

    # For demonstration, we'll just show how a correct seed leads to the correct sequence.
    # In a real attack, you'd iterate and compare `predicted_token` with the `observed_token`.

    observed_token = "123456" # Replace with an actual token observed from the vulnerable server
    found_seed = None
    search_window_seconds = 5

    print(f"\n[*] Attempting to brute-force seeds around {start_time_ns} ns...")

    # Iterate through potential seeds. The range needs to be adjusted based on system clock granularity.
    # Here, we'll try a small range around the exact time of the request for demonstration.
    for offset_ns in range(-search_window_seconds * 1_000_000_000, search_window_seconds * 1_000_000_000, 1_000_000): # Check every millisecond
        seed_candidate = start_time_ns + offset_ns

        # Generate the first number with this seed
        predicted_first_token = generate_insecure_token_py(seed_candidate)

        # If this matches the observed token, we've found the seed!
        if predicted_first_token == observed_token:
            found_seed = seed_candidate

**Explanation:** This PoC demonstrates that by observing a single "random" token and its approximate generation time, an attacker can brute-force the predictable `math/rand` seed. Once the seed is determined, the attacker can accurately predict subsequent tokens, enabling them to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the victim's account. The small range of the 6-digit token further simplifies the brute-force process.

## Risk Classification

The vulnerability of cryptographically insecure random numbers falls under the following widely recognized risk classifications:

- **CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm**. This Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) specifically addresses the use of cryptographic algorithms that are known to be weak, broken, or improperly implemented, leading to security vulnerabilities. The `math/rand` package, when used for cryptographic purposes, perfectly fits this description due to its predictable nature.
- **OWASP Top 10 A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures**. This category in the OWASP Top 10 highlights common issues related to cryptography that can lead to sensitive data exposure or system compromise. Insecure random number generation is a direct cause of cryptographic failures, as it undermines the unpredictability essential for secure cryptographic operations.

This vulnerability directly impacts the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems. It is a direct manifestation of a cryptographic failure resulting from the selection and misuse of an inappropriate algorithm for security-sensitive contexts.

## Fix & Patch Guidance

Addressing the vulnerability of cryptographically insecure random numbers requires both immediate code changes and a broader strategy for secure development practices.

### Immediate Fix

The most critical step is to replace all instances of `math/rand` with `crypto/rand` for any operation that requires cryptographically strong, unpredictable random numbers.

- **For Random Bytes:** Use `crypto/rand.Read(bbyte)` to fill a byte slice with cryptographically secure random bytes. This is the fundamental building block for secure random number generation.
- **For Secure Tokens/Strings:** For generating secure tokens, passwords, or other arbitrary secret strings, `crypto/rand.Text()` is the recommended function. It guarantees at least 128 bits of randomness, sufficient to prevent brute-force guessing and minimize collision likelihood.
- **For Secure Integers:** When a cryptographically secure random integer within a specific range is needed (e.g., for large number cryptography), `crypto/rand.Int(rand.Reader, max *big.Int)` should be used.

If `math/rand` *must* be used for non-security purposes (e.g., simulations, games where reproducibility is desired), it is crucial to ensure that it is *not* seeded with predictable values like timestamps. Instead, a fixed, non-sensitive seed or a seed derived from `crypto/rand` (for initial seeding of a `math/rand` source, if truly necessary for a specific non-security reproducible test case) could be considered, though this adds complexity and risk of misuse.

### Patching

- **Update Affected Dependencies:** Ensure that all third-party Go packages and libraries used in the application are updated to their latest versions, especially if they have known vulnerabilities related to insecure randomness. For instance, `github.com/greenpau/caddy-security` was patched in version 1.0.42 to address CVE-2024-21495 by replacing `math/rand` with `crypto/rand`.
- **Regular Updates:** Establish a routine for regularly updating the Go standard library and all project dependencies to benefit from ongoing security improvements and vulnerability fixes.

## Scope and Impact

The scope of this vulnerability extends to any Go application or library that leverages `math/rand` for generating random numbers in contexts where cryptographic strength and unpredictability are paramount. This encompasses a wide range of software, including web applications, backend services, microservices, and any system requiring unique, unpredictable identifiers or cryptographic material. The impact of such a vulnerability can propagate beyond the immediate vulnerable component, as a compromised "random" value can affect other parts of the system (e.g., a predictable session token leading to broader account compromise).

The impact of insecure random number generation is severe and multi-faceted:

- **Data Breach and Information Disclosure:** Predictable random values can directly lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. This includes user credentials, personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or the compromise of encryption keys, allowing attackers to decrypt confidential information.
- **Authentication Bypass and Session Hijacking:** Attackers can predict values such as session IDs, password reset tokens, or multi-factor authentication (MFA) secrets. This enables them to impersonate legitimate users, hijack active sessions, or gain unauthorized access to accounts, bypassing established authentication mechanisms.
- **System Integrity Compromise:** If predictable nonces or initialization vectors (IVs) are used in cryptographic protocols, the integrity of encrypted data can be undermined. This could allow attackers to tamper with or manipulate data, leading to unauthorized state changes or a loss of data trustworthiness.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** In scenarios where random numbers are critical for resource allocation, process identification, or other essential system operations, their predictability could be exploited. This might lead to resource exhaustion, conflicts, or system crashes, resulting in a denial of service for legitimate users.
- **Reputational Damage:** Beyond direct technical and financial losses, data breaches and system compromises stemming from insecure randomness can severely damage an organization's reputation, erode user trust, and incur legal and regulatory penalties.

## Remediation Recommendation

Effective remediation of cryptographically insecure random numbers requires a multi-pronged approach that combines immediate technical fixes with long-term strategic changes in development practices.

1. **Developer Education and Awareness:** It is paramount to educate developers on the fundamental differences between Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) and Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generators (CSPRNGs). This education should emphasize the critical need for `crypto/rand` in all security-sensitive contexts. Addressing the underlying misconception that all "random" numbers are suitable for security applications is key to preventing future vulnerabilities.
2. **Enforce Secure by Design Principles:** Implement and enforce a strict organizational policy that mandates the exclusive use of `crypto/rand` for all security-sensitive random number generation. To ensure consistency and prevent code duplication, create and promote the use of secure wrapper functions that abstract the complexities of `crypto/rand` usage, providing a simplified, secure API for common tasks like token generation.
3. **Integrate Automated Security Testing:** Embed Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, such as Gosec (specifically configuring the `G404` rule) and Semgrep (using the `math-random-used` rule), directly into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. These tools should be configured to automatically detect `math/rand` usage in production code and flag it as a high-severity issue, ideally blocking builds or deployments until resolved.
4. **Robust Dependency Management:** Implement comprehensive dependency scanning solutions to identify and track third-party libraries that may contain or introduce insecure randomness vulnerabilities. Regularly review and update dependencies to ensure that any known issues are patched promptly.
5. **Thorough Code Review:** Conduct diligent manual code reviews, with a specific focus on random number generation. This is particularly important for new features or modifications within security-critical components, as human review can often catch subtle logic flaws that automated tools might miss.
6. **Principle of Least Privilege for Generated Resources:** Even when `crypto/rand` is used, ensure that any temporary files or other resources whose names or properties are derived from random numbers are created with the most restrictive permissions possible. This practice limits the potential impact if other, unrelated vulnerabilities were to exist.

## Summary

The use of cryptographically insecure random numbers, particularly from Go's `math/rand` package, poses a significant and often critical security vulnerability in applications. Unlike `crypto/rand`, `math/rand` generates predictable sequences, especially when seeded with common, easily guessable values like timestamps. This predictability allows attackers to anticipate sensitive values such as session tokens, password reset codes, or even cryptographic keys, leading to severe consequences including authentication bypass, data breaches, and system compromise. The problem often stems from a fundamental misunderstanding among developers regarding the distinction between general-purpose pseudorandomness and the cryptographic strength required for security. Remediation necessitates a shift to `crypto/rand` for all security-sensitive operations, coupled with robust developer education, integrated automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines, and diligent code review practices to ensure that unpredictability, a cornerstone of modern security, is consistently maintained.
