# **Command Injection via Parameters: A Technical Analysis**

## **Vulnerability Title**

Command Injection via Parameters (cmd-injection)

## **Severity Rating**

Command Injection vulnerabilities are consistently rated as **HighðŸŸ ** to **CriticalðŸ”´**. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) often assigns base scores in the range of 7.0 to 10.0, reflecting the potential for complete system compromise. For instance, CVE-2024-20418, a command injection vulnerability, received a CVSS score of 10 (Critical), while CVE-2025-0975 was rated 8.8 (High). The severity stems from the attacker's ability to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system, potentially leading to full control over the affected server and enabling further attacks within the network.

## **Description**

Command injection, often abbreviated as cmd-injection, is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application incorporates untrusted data into an operating system (OS) command. Specifically, "command injection via parameters" refers to scenarios where the external input, typically passed as parameters to a script or program, is not properly validated or sanitized. This allows an attacker to manipulate these parameters to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands on the host system.

The core of the vulnerability lies in the application's failure to distinguish between legitimate data and malicious commands embedded within that data. When an application constructs a command string by concatenating user-supplied input and then passes this string to a system shell for execution, it creates an opportunity for an attacker to alter the intended command or append new ones. This differs from code injection, where the attacker injects code in the language of the application itself; command injection targets the system shell.

## **Technical Description (for security pros)**

Command injection vulnerabilities are exploited by manipulating input parameters that an application uses to construct commands for execution by a system shell (e.g., `/bin/sh`, `bash` on Unix-like systems, or `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe` on Windows). The shell interprets these commands, and if user input is part of the command string without proper sanitization, the shell may interpret parts of the input as new commands or command modifiers.

The mechanism involves the use of shell metacharacters, which have special meaning to the shell. When an attacker can inject these metacharacters into an input parameter, they can terminate the intended command and append their own. For example, a semicolon (`;`) can be used to separate multiple commands on a single line in Unix-like shells. Other metacharacters like `|`, `&&`, `||`, backticks (```), and `$( )` can also be used to manipulate command execution flow or capture command output.

In the context of Golang, the `os/exec` package is commonly used to run external commands. A critical distinction exists in how `os/exec` can be used:

1. **Direct Execution (Safer):** `exec.Command(commandPath, arg1, arg2,...)`
When arguments are passed as separate strings, `os/exec` typically does not invoke a system shell. It behaves more like C's `exec` family of functions, directly executing the specified command with the given arguments. This significantly reduces the risk of command injection because the arguments are treated as literal data, not as shell-parseable strings.
    
2. **Shell Invocation (Dangerous with Untrusted Input):** `exec.Command("sh", "-c", untrustedCommandString)` or `exec.Command("powershell", "/c", untrustedCommandString)`
In this pattern, a shell is explicitly invoked, and the `untrustedCommandString` is passed to it for interpretation. If `untrustedCommandString` contains user-supplied data that hasn't been rigorously sanitized, any embedded shell metacharacters will be processed by the shell, leading to command injection.
    

The vulnerability arises not from `os/exec` itself, but from its misuse when developers construct command strings containing unsanitized external input and then pass these strings to a shell for execution.

The following table lists common shell metacharacters and their functions, which attackers leverage in command injection:

| **Metacharacter(s)** | **Name/Function** | **Example Usage (Illustrative)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `;` | Command Separator | `command1; command2` |
| `&&` | Conditional AND (execute next if previous succeeds) | `command1 && command2` |
| `\ | \ | ` |
| `\ | ` | Pipe (output of command1 to input of command2) |
| `>` | Redirect Output (overwrite) | `command > file.txt` |
| `>>` | Redirect Output (append) | `command >> file.txt` |
| `<` | Redirect Input | `command < file.txt` |
| ``` | Backticks (Command Substitution - legacy) | `echo \`whoami`` |
| `$( )` | Command Substitution (preferred) | `echo $(whoami)` |
| `&` | Background Process | `command &` |
| `\` | Escape Character | `echo "This is a \"quote\""` |
| `"` / `'` | String Quotation | `echo "String with spaces"` |
| `\n` or `\r` | Newline / Carriage Return (can terminate commands) | `command1\ncommand2` (in some contexts) |

Understanding these metacharacters is crucial for recognizing how an attacker can break out of the intended command structure and inject their own malicious commands by manipulating input parameters.

## **Common Mistakes That Cause This**

Command injection vulnerabilities often stem from a set of recurring mistakes in software development, particularly when interacting with the operating system:

1. **Direct Concatenation of User Input into Command Strings:** The most frequent error is constructing command strings by directly appending or embedding unvalidated user input. For example, in Go, `cmdStr := "ls " + userInput` and then passing `cmdStr` to `exec.Command("sh", "-c", cmdStr)` is highly vulnerable.
    
2. **Lack of or Improper Input Validation and Sanitization:** Failing to validate that user input conforms to expected formats, lengths, and character sets, or attempting to sanitize input with inadequate blocklists (which can often be bypassed) instead of strict allow-lists.
    
3. **Implicit Trust in External Input:** Assuming that input from users, other services, files, or environment variables is safe and does not require validation before being used in OS commands. Any external data source should be treated as potentially hostile.
4. **Misunderstanding of Command Execution Libraries:** In Go, a common mistake is not understanding the difference between `exec.Command(command, args...)` which (by default) does not use a shell, and `exec.Command("sh", "-c", commandString)` which explicitly invokes a shell. Using the latter with concatenated user input is a primary cause of this vulnerability.
    
5. **Incorrect Use of Shells:** Deliberately invoking a shell (e.g., `sh -c`, `bash -c`, `powershell /c`) to execute commands constructed with user input, often for perceived convenience in handling complex commands or shell features like pipes and redirection, without realizing the security implications.
    
6. **Environment Variable Mismanagement:** If environment variables are set based on user input and then used by scripts executed via `os/exec`, these can sometimes be a vector for injection if the scripts themselves are vulnerable or interpret these variables in an unsafe way.
7. **Over-reliance on Client-Side Validation:** Assuming client-side validation is sufficient and neglecting robust server-side validation for parameters that will be used in server-side command execution.
8. **Focusing on Denylisting instead of Allow-listing:** Trying to identify and block all possible malicious characters (denylisting) is error-prone and often incomplete. A more secure approach is to define a strict set of allowed characters or values (allow-listing) and reject everything else.
    

These mistakes often arise from a lack of security awareness or an underestimation of the capabilities of attackers to craft malicious inputs. The seemingly innocuous act of including a parameter in a system command can become a significant security hole if not handled with extreme caution.

## **Exploitation Goals**

Attackers exploit command injection vulnerabilities to achieve a variety of malicious objectives, typically starting with the execution of arbitrary commands on the target server. The initial command execution is often a means to an end, paving the way for more significant compromises.

Common exploitation goals include:

- **Arbitrary Code/Command Execution:** This is the immediate goal, allowing the attacker to run any command that the compromised application's user privileges permit on the host operating system. This confirms the vulnerability and provides a foothold.
    
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can access, exfiltrate, or modify sensitive data stored on the server or accessible by it. This includes application data, user credentials, configuration files, databases, and intellectual property. For instance, commands like `cat /etc/passwd`, `mysqldump`, or custom scripts to search for sensitive files can be executed.

    
- **System Compromise and Control:** The ultimate goal is often to gain full control over the server. This can involve installing backdoors, rootkits, or remote access trojans (RATs) to maintain persistent access. Attackers might also create new user accounts or modify existing ones.
    
- **Service Disruption (Denial of Service - DoS):** Attackers can execute commands that disrupt services, delete critical files, shut down the server, or consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
    
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the application is running with limited privileges, attackers will often attempt to escalate their privileges to root or administrator level, granting them unrestricted control over the system.
- **Lateral Movement:** Once a server is compromised, attackers may use it as a pivot point to launch further attacks against other systems within the internal network. The compromised server becomes a beachhead for reconnaissance and exploitation of internal resources.
    
- **Cryptocurrency Mining:** Attackers may install cryptocurrency mining software to leverage the compromised server's computational resources for their financial gain.
- **Botnet Participation:** The compromised server can be enlisted into a botnet, to be used for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, spam distribution, or other illicit activities.

The progression of an attack often starts with a simple command to verify the injection (e.g., `whoami` or `ls`). If successful, the attacker typically attempts to establish a more stable channel of communication, such as a reverse shell, to facilitate further actions. The initial command injection vulnerability, therefore, acts as a critical entry point, the exploitation of which can cascade into a full-scale organizational compromise. This underscores the necessity of not only preventing the initial injection but also implementing defense-in-depth strategies to detect and mitigate post-exploitation activities.

## **Affected Components or Files**

Command injection vulnerabilities are not confined to specific files or components by name, but rather to any part of an application where operating system commands are constructed and executed using data from external, untrusted sources. The vulnerability lies in the *pattern* of unsafe command construction and execution.

Components that are commonly affected include:

- **Backend Application Code:** Any server-side code, regardless of the programming language (Go, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Node.js, etc.), that uses functions or libraries to execute external OS commands.
    - In **Golang**, this specifically involves the misuse of the `os/exec` package, particularly functions like `exec.Command()`, `exec.CommandContext()`, and to a lesser extent older or more direct system call wrappers like `syscall.Exec()` and `os.StartProcess()` if they are used to invoke a shell with user-controlled input. The Kubernetes CVE-2023-3676, for example, involved the Kubelet (written in Go) passing unsanitized input to PowerShell commands.
        
- **Web Server Scripts:** Legacy CGI scripts or scripts written in languages like Perl, PHP, Python, or Ruby that are executed by a web server and take parameters from HTTP requests (GET or POST) to form system commands.
    
- **APIs and Microservices:** Endpoints that accept parameters which are subsequently used in system calls. Even internal APIs can be a vector if they consume input that can be influenced by an external attacker through a chain of calls.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Tools:** If a CLI tool accepts arguments that are then used unsafely to construct further system commands, it can be vulnerable, especially if these arguments can be supplied by other processes or users.
- **Configuration Management and Deployment Scripts:** Scripts used for automation, deployment, or system configuration can be vulnerable if they dynamically generate and execute commands based on parameters that might originate from less trusted sources (e.g., metadata from a cloud provider, user-defined configuration files).
- **System Utilities or Binaries:** While the primary vulnerability is in the application calling the utility, the way an application passes arguments to system utilities can lead to injection if those utilities themselves parse arguments in a way that can be exploited or if the application wraps the utility call in a shell.

The critical factor is the data flow: if external input can influence the string of a command executed by a shell, or the arguments to a command in a way that changes its behavior maliciously, that component is affected. This means security reviews must meticulously trace data from all external sources (HTTP requests, API calls, database queries, file reads, environment variables) to any point where OS commands are executed.

## **Vulnerable Code Snippet**

The following Golang code snippets illustrate common patterns leading to command injection vulnerabilities.

**Example 1: Explicit Shell Invocation with User Input**

This example demonstrates a handler in a web application that takes a parameter from a URL query and directly concatenates it into a command string executed by `sh -c`.

```Go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"os/exec"
)

func vulnerableHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	param := r.URL.Query().Get("param")
	if param == "" {
		http.Error(w, "Missing 'param' parameter", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	// VULNERABLE: User input is directly concatenated into a command string
	// and executed via a shell.
	commandString := "echo User provided: " + param
	cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", commandString) // Explicit shell invocation

	output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err!= nil {
		http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Command execution failed: %v", err), http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain")
	w.Write(output)
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/vuln", vulnerableHandler)
	fmt.Println("Server starting on port 8080...")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

Why it's vulnerable:

The param variable, taken directly from the user's HTTP request, is concatenated into commandString. This string is then passed to sh -c, which tells the shell to interpret commandString as a series of commands. An attacker can provide a param value like test; ls -la which would cause the shell to execute echo User provided: test followed by ls -la.4

**Example 2: Command String Construction for PowerShell (Similar to CVE-2023-3676)**

This example simulates a scenario where user input is formatted into a PowerShell command string. While `fmt.Sprintf` with `%q` can offer some quoting, it's not a foolproof defense against all forms of injection, especially if the overall command structure allows for PowerShell's expression evaluation or script block invocation if not carefully constrained. The primary vulnerability remains passing a constructed string to `powershell -Command` or `/c`.

```Go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"os/exec"
)

func vulnerablePowerShellHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	filePath := r.URL.Query().Get("path")
	if filePath == "" {
		http.Error(w, "Missing 'path' parameter", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	// VULNERABLE: User input is formatted into a PowerShell command string.
	// While %q adds quotes, complex inputs or different PowerShell contexts
	// might still allow injection if not handled with extreme care.
	// The fundamental issue is executing a constructed string via a shell.
	commandString := fmt.Sprintf("Get-ChildItem -Path '%s'", filePath) // Single quotes used for illustration
	cmd := exec.Command("powershell", "-Command", commandString)      // Invokes PowerShell to interpret the string

	output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err!= nil {
		http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("PowerShell execution failed: %v", err), http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain")
	w.Write(output)
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/psvuln", vulnerablePowerShellHandler)
	fmt.Println("Server starting on port 8080...")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

Why it's vulnerable:

Similar to the first example, filePath is taken from user input and embedded within a command string. This string is then executed by PowerShell. An attacker could craft a path parameter to break out of the intended Get-ChildItem command and execute arbitrary PowerShell commands, for example, C'; Invoke-Expression 'calc.exe' #.10 The use of fmt.Sprintf to build command strings that are then passed to a shell interpreter is a dangerous pattern.

These snippets illustrate that the core issue arises when external input influences the structure of a command string that is subsequently interpreted by a system shell. The simplicity of such code can be deceptive, hiding significant security risks.

## **Detection Steps**

Detecting command injection vulnerabilities requires a combination of manual and automated techniques, focusing on how external input is handled when OS commands are executed.

1. **Manual Code Review:**
    - **Identify Command Execution Points:** Scrutinize the codebase for all instances where external OS commands are executed. In Golang, this primarily involves looking for uses of the `os/exec` package (e.g., `exec.Command`, `exec.CommandContext`) and, less commonly, `syscall.Exec` or `os.StartProcess`.
        
    - **Trace Data Flow:** For each command execution point, trace the origin of the command itself and all its arguments. Determine if any part of the command string or its arguments can be influenced by external input sources such as HTTP request parameters (query strings, form data, headers), file contents, database entries, environment variables, or data from other services.
    - **Analyze Command Construction:** If external input is used, check *how* it's incorporated. Direct concatenation or string formatting of user input into a command string that is then passed to a shell (e.g., `exec.Command("sh", "-c", constructedString)`) is a strong indicator of a vulnerability.
    - **Verify Input Validation:** Assess the robustness of any input validation or sanitization mechanisms. Look for reliance on denylists (which are often incomplete), insufficient character escaping, or validation logic that can be bypassed. The absence of server-side validation for inputs used in commands is a major red flag.
2. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**
    - Employ SAST tools that are capable of performing taint analysis. These tools attempt to trace the flow of untrusted data (tainted sources) to potentially dangerous functions (sinks), such as those executing OS commands.
    - For Golang, tools like `gosec` , SonarQube , and Datadog Static Analysis (which has a specific rule `go-security/command-injection` ) can help identify potential command injection flaws.

    - SAST tools can automate the detection of common vulnerable patterns but may produce false positives or miss complex vulnerabilities requiring deeper contextual understanding.
3. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**
    - Use DAST tools or conduct manual penetration testing to actively probe the application with malicious inputs.
    - Inject common shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&&`, ```, `$( )`) and OS commands (e.g., `id`, `whoami`, `sleep 5`, `nslookup attacker.com`) into all input parameters that might be used in OS command execution.
    - Observe the application's behavior for:
        - **Direct command output:** The output of the injected command appearing in the HTTP response.
        - **Errors:** Unexpected errors that might indicate a command was partially executed or malformed.
        - **Time delays:** If a `sleep` command is successfully injected, the application's response will be delayed.
        - **Out-of-band interactions:** Injected commands that cause the server to make DNS lookups, HTTP requests, or other network connections to an attacker-controlled system.
    - Automated DAST solutions, such as Bright, can scan for OS command injection vulnerabilities.
        
4. **Fuzz Testing:**
    - Implement fuzz testing for input parameters that are suspected to be used in command execution. Fuzzers generate a large volume of varied, malformed, and unexpected inputs, which can uncover edge cases in parsing or command construction logic that lead to injection vulnerabilities.

A comprehensive detection strategy leverages multiple methods. SAST can identify potential issues early in the development cycle by analyzing source code. DAST and manual testing can confirm the exploitability of these issues in a running application. Manual code review remains crucial for understanding complex logic and data flows that automated tools might miss.

## **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

This Proof of Concept demonstrates how the `vulnerableHandler` function from Section 8 (Example 1) can be exploited.

**Assumptions:**

- The Go application with the `vulnerableHandler` is compiled and running.
- The web server is listening on `http://localhost:8080`.
- The vulnerable endpoint is `http://localhost:8080/vuln`.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Baseline Test (Legitimate Request):
    
    Open a web browser or use a command-line tool like curl to send a legitimate request:
    
    curl "http://localhost:8080/vuln?param=world"
    
    - **Expected Output:** The server should respond with:
    User provided: world
2. Injecting a Simple Command (whoami):
    
    Craft a URL that injects a command using a semicolon (;) as a command separator. The semicolon allows a second command to be executed after the echo command.
    
    curl "http://localhost:8080/vuln?param=world;%20whoami"
    
    - **Explanation:**
        - `param=world; whoami` is the intended payload.
        - `%20` is the URL encoding for a space character.
        - The shell will interpret this as two commands: `echo User provided: world` AND `whoami`.
    - **Expected Output (assuming the application runs as user `appuser`):**
    User provided: world
    appuser
    The output of `whoami` (e.g., `appuser`) is appended to the output of the `echo` command. This confirms that the `whoami` command was executed on the server.
3. Injecting a Command to Read a File (e.g., /etc/hostname or a test file):
    
    Attempt to read a file from the server. For demonstration, let's assume a file /tmp/testfile.txt exists on the server with the content "Hello from testfile".
    
    curl "http://localhost:8080/vuln?param=world;%20cat%20/tmp/testfile.txt"
    
    - **Explanation:**
        - The injected command is `cat /tmp/testfile.txt`.
    - **Expected Output:**
    User provided: world
    Hello from testfile
    If `/etc/passwd` were readable by the application's user, `param=world;%20cat%20/etc/passwd` could be used.
4. Injecting a Command Causing a Time Delay (sleep):
    
    This PoC demonstrates command execution by introducing an observable delay.
    
    curl "http://localhost:8080/vuln?param=world;%20sleep%205"
    
    - **Explanation:**
        - The injected command is `sleep 5`, which causes the shell to pause for 5 seconds.
    - **Expected Behavior:** The HTTP response from `curl` will be delayed by approximately 5 seconds before returning the output:
    User provided: world
    The delay itself is the proof of execution.

These PoC steps clearly demonstrate that an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server by manipulating the `param` URL parameter. This is a direct result of the vulnerable code pattern identified in Section 8. A similar approach could be used for the PowerShell example, crafting the `path` parameter to include malicious PowerShell syntax like `C'; Start-Process calc.exe #`.

## **Risk Classification**

Command injection vulnerabilities are typically classified as **High** or **Critical** risk due to their potential for severe impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the targeted system and data. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is widely used for this classification.

A typical CVSS v3.1 base score for a network-exploitable command injection vulnerability often falls in the 9.0-10.0 range. For example, CVE-2024-20418, a command injection flaw, was assigned a CVSS score of 10.0 (Critical), while CVE-2025-0975 received an 8.8 (High). The PortSwigger Web Security Academy also classifies OS command injection as typically "High" severity.

The following table breaks down the CVSS v3.1 metrics for a common command injection scenario in a web application:

| **CVSS Metric** | **Typical Value(s)** | **Justification for Command Injection** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Attack Vector (AV)** | Network (N) | The vulnerability is often exploitable over the network, e.g., via an HTTP request to a web application. |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | Low (L) | If the injection point is straightforward (e.g., a simple parameter), the attack complexity is typically low. No specialized conditions or significant effort needed. |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | None (N) or Low (L) | Often exploitable without authentication (N). If authentication is required but is a low privilege level (L), the score is still high. |
| **User Interaction (UI)** | None (N) | Successful exploitation usually does not require any interaction from a user other than the attacker. |
| **Scope (S)** | Unchanged (U) or Changed (C) | If compromise is limited to the server running the application, Scope is Unchanged. If the attacker can pivot to affect other systems/components, Scope is Changed (C), which significantly increases severity. |
| **Confidentiality (C)** | High (H) | Attackers can often read sensitive files, databases, and configurations, leading to a total loss of confidentiality. |
| **Integrity (I)** | High (H) | Attackers can modify or delete data, alter system behavior, and install malicious software, leading to a total loss of integrity. |
| **Availability (A)** | High (H) | Attackers can shut down services, delete critical files, or consume all system resources, leading to a total loss of availability. |

Resulting CVSS Score Example (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H): 9.8 (Critical)

Resulting CVSS Score Example (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H): 10.0 (Critical) 2

The "Privileges Required" (PR) and "Scope" (S) metrics are key differentiators. An unauthenticated command injection (PR:N) that allows an attacker to affect components beyond the initially compromised system (S:C) will almost invariably be rated as Critical. Even if the scope is unchanged and low privileges are required, the impact on the CIA triad of the vulnerable component itself is typically high, justifying a high overall risk classification. This high risk underscores the urgency of remediating command injection vulnerabilities.

## **Fix & Patch Guidance**

The most effective way to fix and prevent command injection vulnerabilities is to avoid invoking a system shell with user-controlled data. For Golang applications using the `os/exec` package, specific practices should be followed:

1. Primary Fix: Avoid Shell Invocation by Passing Arguments Separately:
    
    This is the cornerstone of preventing command injection in Go. Use exec.Command(command, args...) by providing the path to the executable as the first argument and all subsequent arguments as separate strings. The os/exec package, when used this way, does not typically invoke a system shell to interpret the command and its arguments. This means shell metacharacters in the arguments are treated as literal parts of the argument strings, not as special shell instructions.4
    
    - **Secure (Correct) Usage in Go:**
        
        ```go
        
        import "os/exec"
        // userInput comes from an external source
        cmd := exec.Command("/bin/ls", "-l", userInput)
        err := cmd.Run()
        // Handle err
        ```
        
    - **Insecure (Incorrect) Usage in Go:**
        
        ```Go
        
        import "os/exec"
        // userInput comes from an external source
        // VULNERABLE: userInput is part of a string passed to sh -c
        cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "ls -l " + userInput)
        err := cmd.Run()
        // Handle err
        ```
        
    
    The following table contrasts insecure and secure coding patterns for the same task using `os/exec` in Go:
    

| **Scenario** | **Insecure Go Code (Vulnerable)** | **Secure Go Code (Resistant)** | **Explanation of Vulnerability/Security** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Listing directory contents with user-provided path | `cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "ls " + userPath)` | `cmd := exec.Command("ls", userPath)` | **Vulnerable:** `userPath` is concatenated into a shell command string, allowing injection (e.g., `userPath = "; rm -rf /"`). **Secure:** `userPath` is passed as a distinct argument; shell metacharacters are not interpreted. |
| Echoing user input | `cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "echo " + userInput)` | `cmd := exec.Command("echo", userInput)` | **Vulnerable:** `userInput` can contain shell commands (e.g., `hello; id`). **Secure:** `userInput` is treated as a literal string to be echoed. |
| Finding files with a user-provided pattern | `cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "find / -name " + userPattern)` | `cmd := exec.Command("find", "/", "-name", userPattern)` | **Vulnerable:** `userPattern` could be crafted like `*.txt; reboot`. **Secure:** `userPattern` is passed as a safe argument to `find`. |
1. Implement Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:
    
    If there is an unavoidable scenario where user input must influence parts of a command (which should be extremely rare and carefully justified), apply rigorous input validation using an allow-list approach. Define precisely what characters, formats, and values are acceptable for each piece of input. Reject any input that does not conform strictly to this allow-list.4 Sanitization (attempting to escape or remove malicious characters) is a less reliable secondary defense and is notoriously difficult to implement perfectly for all shell contexts.
    
2. Use Built-in Language Features or Libraries:
    
    Whenever possible, use native Go libraries or functions to perform tasks instead of shelling out to external OS commands. For example, use Go's os package for file operations, net/http for HTTP requests, etc. This reduces the attack surface associated with external command execution.12
    
3. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:
    
    Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary operating system privileges. If a command injection vulnerability is exploited, this will limit the potential damage an attacker can inflict.12
    
4. Contextual Output Encoding:
    
    If the output of any executed command is displayed back to users (e.g., in a web page), ensure it is properly encoded for the context in which it is displayed (e.g., HTML encoding) to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

The primary and most robust fix is to ensure that user-controlled data is never interpreted by a system shell. By passing command arguments directly and separately, Go's `os/exec` package facilitates this secure approach.

## **Scope and Impact**

Command injection vulnerabilities have a broad scope and can lead to severe impacts, affecting the core security principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Scope:**

- **Application and Host System:** The immediate scope is the application itself and the underlying host operating system where the vulnerable application is running. An attacker can execute commands with the privileges of the application process.
    
- **Operating System Agnostic:** The vulnerability concept applies to applications running on any operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.) if they improperly execute OS commands.
- **Language Agnostic:** While this report focuses on Go, command injection can occur in applications written in any programming language that allows interaction with the system shell (e.g., PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, Perl).
    
- **Potential for Network-Wide Impact:** A compromised host can serve as a staging ground for an attacker to pivot and launch further attacks against other systems within the same network. This can escalate a localized application vulnerability into a broader internal network compromise. The initial point of entry might be a single vulnerable parameter, but the subsequent actions can extend far beyond that.
    
**Impact:**

The successful exploitation of a command injection vulnerability can have devastating consequences:

- **Loss of Confidentiality:** Attackers can read sensitive data from the compromised system. This includes application source code, configuration files containing credentials (database passwords, API keys), user data, private keys, and any other information accessible to the compromised process.
    
- **Loss of Integrity:** Attackers can modify or delete critical data and files on the system. They can alter application behavior, plant malware or ransomware, tamper with logs to hide their activities, or deface websites. The integrity of the entire system can be undermined.
    
- **Loss of Availability:** Services can be disrupted or completely taken offline. Attackers might achieve this by deleting essential files, terminating processes, consuming all system resources (CPU, memory, disk space), or initiating a system shutdown or reboot. This leads to denial of service for legitimate users.
    
- **Complete System Takeover:** Often, command injection allows an attacker to gain full administrative (root or Administrator) control over the host operating system, especially if the vulnerable application is running with elevated privileges or if the attacker can escalate privileges post-exploitation.
    
- **Reputational Damage and Financial Loss:** Data breaches, service outages, and the compromise of user trust can lead to significant financial losses, regulatory fines, and long-lasting damage to an organization's reputation.
    

The impact is rarely isolated to just the initial command executed. Once an attacker gains a foothold, they typically attempt to escalate privileges, establish persistence, and exfiltrate data or cause further disruption. The initial vulnerability, therefore, often serves as a gateway to a much larger compromise. This highlights the critical importance of preventing, detecting, and rapidly remediating command injection flaws.

## **Remediation Recommendation**

The primary goal of remediation for command injection vulnerabilities is to prevent external input from being interpreted as OS commands by a system shell. The following recommendations, with a focus on Golang applications, should be implemented:

1. **Prioritize Avoiding Direct Shell Interaction (Safest Approach):**
    - In Golang, the most robust defense is to use `os/exec.Command(path, arg1, arg2,...)` where `path` is the verified path to an executable, and `arg1, arg2,...` are all subsequent arguments passed as distinct strings. This method, by default, does not invoke a system shell, and arguments containing special characters are typically passed literally to the executable, not interpreted by a shell. Ensure that the `path` itself is not derived from untrusted input or is thoroughly validated if it is.
        
    - **Crucially, DO NOT use patterns like `exec.Command("sh", "-c", untrustedString)` or `exec.Command("powershell", "-Command", untrustedString)` where `untrustedString` contains externally-influenced data.**
2. **Implement Strong, Allow-List-Based Input Validation:**
    - If user input must influence which command is run or what parameters are used (even when not invoking a shell directly), validate this input against a strict allow-list of expected values, formats, and character sets. Reject any input that does not conform. For example, if a parameter is expected to be a number, convert it to a numeric type and validate its range. If it's a filename, ensure it only contains permitted characters and does not allow path traversal.
        
3. **Utilize API-Based Alternatives:**
    - Before resorting to executing external OS commands, investigate whether the desired functionality can be achieved through native Go libraries or by interacting with other programs/systems via APIs. APIs generally provide a more structured and safer way to pass data than constructing command-line strings.
4. **Contextual Escaping (Use with Extreme Caution and as a Last Resort):**
    - If, for some legacy or unavoidable reason, user input must be embedded within a command string that will be interpreted by a shell (this is highly discouraged), then all shell metacharacters within that input *must* be meticulously escaped. This is extremely difficult to do correctly and comprehensively for all possible shell interpreters and edge cases, making it a very brittle defense. This should not be the primary defense.
5. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    - Run the application with the minimum necessary OS privileges. This will limit the potential damage an attacker can inflict if a command injection vulnerability is successfully exploited.
        
6. **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    - Conduct regular security audits and thorough code reviews, specifically looking for patterns of unsafe command construction and execution. Train developers to recognize and avoid these patterns.
        
7. **Developer Training and Awareness:**
    - Educate developers about the risks of command injection, secure coding practices for command execution, and how to use language-specific features (like Go's `os/exec` package) safely.
        
8. **Dependency Management and Vulnerability Scanning:**
    - Keep the Go programming language, its standard library, and all third-party dependencies updated to their latest secure versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.

    - Utilize tools like `govulncheck` to identify known vulnerabilities in Go dependencies.
        
    - Employ SAST and DAST tools as part of the CI/CD pipeline to proactively detect potential command injection flaws.

The most effective remediation strategies focus on eliminating the root causeâ€”the shell's interpretation of user-controlled dataâ€”by design. Relying solely on input sanitization for shell-interpreted commands is significantly riskier than architecting the application to avoid such interpretations altogether.

## **Summary**

Command injection via parameters (cmd-injection) is a critical security vulnerability that arises when an application constructs operating system commands using unsanitized or improperly validated input received through parameters. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands, which are then executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application on the host server. The severity of this vulnerability is consistently rated as High to Critical, as its successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise, including unauthorized data access and modification, service disruption, and the ability to use the compromised system as a pivot point for further attacks within a network.

In Golang applications, command injection typically occurs through the misuse of the `os/exec` package, specifically when developers opt to invoke a system shell (e.g., `sh -c` or `powershell -Command`) with command strings that include concatenated user input, rather than passing the command and its arguments as separate, distinct parameters to `exec.Command`.

Key prevention and remediation strategies for Go developers include:

- **Strictly avoiding shell invocation with user-controlled data:** This is achieved by using `os/exec.Command(commandPath, arg1, arg2,...)` where arguments are passed separately and are not interpreted by a shell.
- **Rigorous input validation:** All external inputs that might influence command execution must be validated against strict allow-lists.
- **Preferring native language libraries or APIs** over shelling out to external commands whenever possible.
- Adhering to the **principle of least privilege** for the application process.

The persistence of command injection vulnerabilities across various systems and languages underscores the ongoing need for developer education, secure coding practices, robust testing methodologies (including SAST and DAST), and a defense-in-depth security posture. While tools and language features can aid in prevention, a foundational understanding of how these vulnerabilities occur and a commitment to secure design principles are paramount for mitigating this significant threat.
