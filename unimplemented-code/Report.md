# Vulnerability Title

Unimplemented Code

## Severity Rating

**MediumðŸŸ¡ to HighðŸŸ ** (depending on the context and functionality of the unimplemented part)

## Description

Unimplemented code refers to functions, methods, or code paths that are declared but not fully developed or are intentionally left incomplete. While sometimes a placeholder for future development (e.g., using `panic("not implemented")` or returning `errors.New("not implemented")`), if these sections are reachable by user input or external calls, they can lead to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or in some cases, more severe security vulnerabilities if error handling or state management around them is improper.

## Technical Description (for security pros)

In Golang, unimplemented code can manifest as functions or interface methods that:
* Contain a `panic("not implemented")` statement.
* Return a generic error like `errors.New("not implemented")` or `status.Errorf(codes.Unimplemented, "method X not implemented")` (common in gRPC services).
* Have empty function bodies.
* Contain placeholder logic that doesn't fulfill the intended functionality.

If these unimplemented sections are part of an externally exposed API, a critical internal process, or a security-sensitive function (e.g., authentication, authorization, input validation), their invocation can lead to application instability or bypass of security controls. For instance, an unimplemented authentication check might inadvertently allow access, or an unimplemented error handler in a complex transaction could leave the system in an inconsistent state.

## Common Mistakes That Cause This

* **Development placeholders:** Leaving `panic()` calls or "TODO" comments with placeholder error returns in production code.
* **Incomplete feature implementation:** Rushing features to production where some functionalities or edge cases are not fully coded.
* **Interface satisfaction without full logic:** Implementing all methods of an interface to satisfy the compiler, but leaving some method bodies empty or with minimal non-functional code.
* **Deadlines and pressure:** Cutting corners in development to meet deadlines, leading to knowingly shipping incomplete code.
* **Miscommunication:** Lack of clarity in development teams about which parts of the code are complete and production-ready.

## Exploitation Goals

* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Triggering a `panic` in an unimplemented section can crash the application or a specific goroutine, making the service unavailable.
* **Information Disclosure:** Panics can sometimes leak stack traces or other sensitive information about the application's internal structure or file system.
* **Bypass Security Controls:** If an unimplemented function was intended to perform a security check (e.g., permission validation) and instead returns a default success or fails open, attackers might gain unauthorized access or privileges.
* **Application Instability/Data Corruption:** If an unimplemented function is part of a larger workflow and doesn't correctly manage state or handle data, it could lead to unpredictable behavior or data inconsistencies.

## Affected Components or Files

* Any Go source file (`.go`) where functions or methods are defined but not fully implemented.
* Specifically, gRPC service implementations, API handlers, business logic modules, and security-critical components (authentication, authorization, session management) are high-risk areas.
* Files related to interface implementations.

## Vulnerable Code Snippet

Consider a gRPC service:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net"

	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/status"

	pb "your_project_protobuf_package" // Assuming you have a protobuf definition
)

// server is used to implement your_project_protobuf_package.YourServiceServer.
type server struct {
	pb.UnimplementedYourServiceServer // Embed for forward compatibility
}

// ProcessData is a method that is defined but not fully implemented.
func (s *server) ProcessData(ctx context.Context, in *pb.DataRequest) (*pb.DataResponse, error) {
	log.Printf("Received: %v", in.GetData())
	// TODO: Implement actual data processing logic
	return nil, status.Errorf(codes.Unimplemented, "method ProcessData not implemented")
}

// CriticalOperation is another method, perhaps for a sensitive action.
func (s *server) CriticalOperation(ctx context.Context, in *pb.CriticalRequest) (*pb.CriticalResponse, error) {
	// Developer intended to add permission checks here but forgot
	if in.GetAction() == "delete_everything" {
		panic("CriticalOperation: delete_everything - Not implemented yet, but should be secured!")
	}
	// Placeholder logic that might fail open or have unintended consequences
	log.Printf("CriticalOperation called with action: %s", in.GetAction())
	return &pb.CriticalResponse{Status: "Action processed (simulated - not really)"}, nil
}

func main() {
	lis, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":50051")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to listen: %v", err)
	}
	s := grpc.NewServer()
	pb.RegisterYourServiceServer(s, &server{})
	log.Printf("server listening at %v", lis.Addr())
	if err := s.Serve(lis); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("failed to serve: %v", err)
	}
}
```

In this example:
* `ProcessData` explicitly returns an `Unimplemented` error, which is informative but still a DoS if called.
* `CriticalOperation` uses `panic` for a specific case and has placeholder logic for others. If the "delete_everything" action is called, it will crash the server. Other actions might appear to succeed without doing anything meaningful or secure.

## Detection Steps

1.  **Manual Code Review:** Look for common patterns like `panic("not implemented")`, `errors.New("not implemented")`, `log.Fatal("not implemented")`, `TODO: implement`, or functions returning `nil` or default values where complex logic is expected. Pay close attention to functions that implement interfaces or handle API requests.
2.  **Static Analysis (SAST):**
    * Use linters like `staticcheck` which can sometimes flag dead code or overly simple function bodies that might indicate unimplemented logic, though it won't specifically catch all "not implemented" placeholders.
    * Custom grep searches for keywords like "Unimplemented", "TODO", "panic", "not implemented".
    * Tools like `gosec` might not directly find "unimplemented code" as a specific vulnerability type but can help identify related security weaknesses.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (DAST):**
    * Thorough integration and fuzz testing can trigger these unimplemented code paths. If an application crashes or returns an "unimplemented" error for a documented feature, it's a clear sign.
4.  **Code Coverage Analysis:** Low code coverage in certain modules or functions might indicate that these parts are not only untested but potentially unimplemented.
5.  **gRPC Specifics:** For gRPC services, calling service methods and checking for `codes.Unimplemented` in the response status is a direct way to detect unimplemented RPC methods.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

Using the vulnerable code snippet above (assuming it's saved as `main.go` and you have the necessary proto definitions for `pb`):

1.  **Compile and run the server:**
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
2.  **Use a gRPC client (e.g., `grpcurl`) to call the `ProcessData` method:**
    ```bash
    # Assuming DataRequest has a string field 'data'
    grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"data": "test"}' localhost:50051 your_project_protobuf_package.YourService/ProcessData
    ```
    **Expected Output:** An error indicating the method is unimplemented.
    ```
    ERROR:
      Code: Unimplemented
      Message: method ProcessData not implemented
    ```
3.  **Call the `CriticalOperation` method with the specific action:**
    ```bash
    # Assuming CriticalRequest has a string field 'action'
    grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"action": "delete_everything"}' localhost:50051 your_project_protobuf_package.YourService/CriticalOperation
    ```
    **Expected Result:** The server will panic and crash. The client will receive a connection error.
    The server log would show the panic message: `panic: CriticalOperation: delete_everything - Not implemented yet, but should be secured!`

## Risk Classification

* **CWE-1059: Incomplete Code Documentation** (While not a perfect match, unimplemented code often goes hand-in-hand with a lack of documentation about its state).
* **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation** (If unimplemented code skips validation).
* **CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions** (If `panic` is used improperly).
* **CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions** (Failing to handle the state of being unimplemented gracefully).
* **CVSS v3.1 Score:** This would vary greatly depending on the impact. A DoS might be 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). If it leads to a security bypass, it could be much higher (e.g., 7.5 to 9.8).

## Fix & Patch Guidance

1.  **Implement the Functionality:** The most obvious fix is to fully implement the missing logic according to the feature's requirements.
2.  **Graceful Error Handling:** If a feature is intentionally not yet available, it should return a clear, user-friendly error message and log the event appropriately, rather than panicking. For APIs, this means returning a proper status code (e.g., HTTP 501 Not Implemented, or gRPC `codes.Unimplemented`).
    ```go
    func (s *server) FeatureX(ctx context.Context, in *pb.FeatureXRequest) (*pb.FeatureXResponse, error) {
        // log.Info("FeatureX called but is not yet implemented.")
        return nil, status.Errorf(codes.Unimplemented, "FeatureX is planned for a future release.")
    }
    ```
3.  **Disable Code Paths:** If the unimplemented code is part of a feature that shouldn't be accessible, ensure that calls to it are prevented through feature flags, routing configurations, or conditional logic.
4.  **Stubbing (for interfaces):** If an interface method cannot be fully implemented yet but is required for compilation, provide a safe, minimal implementation that clearly indicates its status and avoids harmful side effects.
    ```go
    type MyInterface interface {
        DoSomething() error
        DoSomethingElse() (string, error)
    }

    type MyStruct struct{}

    func (s *MyStruct) DoSomething() error {
        return errors.New("DoSomething is not yet implemented but is safe")
    }

    func (s *MyStruct) DoSomethingElse() (string, error) {
        // This is better than panic if it must compile
        return "", errors.New("DoSomethingElse is not implemented")
    }
    ```
5.  **Remove Dead/Unused Code:** If the unimplemented code corresponds to a feature that is no longer planned or needed, remove it entirely.

## Scope and Impact

* **Scope:** Can range from a single minor function to critical parts of an application's core logic or security mechanisms.
* **Impact:**
    * **Denial of Service:** Application crashes or unresponsiveness.
    * **Data Integrity Issues:** If partially implemented functions manipulate data incorrectly.
    * **Security Bypass:** If security-critical functions are not implemented, leading to unauthorized access or actions.
    * **Reputational Damage:** Users encountering frequent errors or crashes due to unimplemented features.
    * **Increased Attack Surface:** Unimplemented but reachable code provides potential points for attackers to probe and exploit.

## Remediation Recommendation

1.  **Prioritize Implementation:** Identify and prioritize the implementation of any unimplemented code paths, especially those in critical or externally-facing components.
2.  **Adopt "Fail-Safe" Defaults:** If code must remain unimplemented temporarily, ensure it fails safely. This means:
    * Avoid panics in production code for unimplemented features.
    * Return appropriate error messages (e.g., gRPC `codes.Unimplemented`, HTTP `501 Not Implemented`).
    * Do not "fail open" (e.g., an unimplemented authorization check should deny access by default, not grant it).
3.  **Improve Development Processes:**
    * Implement stricter code review practices to catch placeholder code before it reaches production.
    * Use feature flags to manage the visibility of incomplete features.
    * Enhance testing strategies, including integration tests and API contract testing, to ensure all defined endpoints/methods behave as expected or return proper "not implemented" errors.
4.  **Regular Code Audits:** Conduct periodic audits to search for "TODO", "FIXME", "panic", and "not implemented" comments or code patterns.
5.  **Use Static Analysis Tools:** Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically flag suspicious placeholder code.
6.  **Clear API Documentation:** Clearly document which features or API endpoints are not yet implemented or are experimental.

## Summary

Unimplemented code in Golang, often marked by `panic` calls or explicit "not implemented" errors, can pose significant risks ranging from denial of service to potential security bypasses if not handled correctly. While sometimes used as temporary placeholders during development, these incomplete sections become vulnerabilities when they are reachable in production environments. Proper remediation involves completing the implementation, providing graceful error handling for features not yet ready, disabling inaccessible code paths, and improving development and testing practices to prevent shipping incomplete code.

* **CWE-1059: Incomplete Code Documentation:** While not a direct match for unimplemented code itself, the lack of proper handling or marking of such code relates to documentation and specification issues. True "unimplemented code" might be better classified under more general CWEs related to improper error handling or unexpected behavior depending on its manifestation. (No specific CWE perfectly captures "shipping unimplemented placeholder code as a vulnerability" directly, it's more of a development flaw leading to other CWEs).
