# Vulnerability Title

Unsecured Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j) leading to Data Exposure/Compromise via Golang Applications

## Severity Rating

**HighðŸŸ  to CriticalðŸ”´** (depending on the sensitivity of the data in the graph database and the level of access gained)

## Description

This vulnerability refers to the scenario where a Go application interacts with a graph database (like Neo4j) that has been improperly secured. This could mean default credentials are in use, authentication is disabled, network exposure is too broad, or authorization controls are missing/misconfigured. The Go application, even if itself secure, can become a vector for attackers to access or manipulate the graph data, or an attacker might bypass the Go application entirely and target the misconfigured database directly.

## Technical Description (for security pros)

Graph databases such as Neo4j store data as nodes and relationships. If not secured, common issues include:

  * **Disabled Authentication:** Neo4j instances might be configured with `dbms.security.auth_enabled=false`.
  * **Default Credentials:** Using default administrative credentials (e.g., `neo4j/neo4j` in older versions, or easily guessable initial passwords if not changed).
  * **Excessive Network Exposure:** The database port (e.g., 7687 for Bolt, 7474 for HTTP) being exposed to untrusted networks (like the internet) without proper firewalling or IP whitelisting.
  * **Lack of Authorization:** Even with authentication, not implementing fine-grained access control using roles and privileges, allowing any authenticated user to access or modify any data.
  * **Unencrypted Communication:** Traffic between the Go application and the database not being encrypted (e.g., not using HTTPS for the HTTP endpoint or secure Bolt `bolt+s` / `neo4j+s`).
  * **Cypher Injection:** If the Go application constructs Cypher queries by concatenating user-supplied input without proper parameterization, it can lead to Cypher injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary queries.

A Golang application interacting with such a database (e.g., using official or third-party Neo4j drivers) can inadvertently read sensitive data, modify data, or an attacker could use the application's credentials (if any) or simply connect directly to the database if authentication is weak or disabled.

## Common Mistakes That Cause This

  * **Not Changing Default Credentials:** Failing to change the default `neo4j` user's password upon first setup.
  * **Disabling Authentication for Convenience:** Turning off authentication (`dbms.security.auth_enabled=false`) during development and forgetting to re-enable it in production.
  * **Exposing Database Ports Publicly:** Binding Neo4j to `0.0.0.0` and not having a firewall to restrict access to its ports (7474, 7473, 7687).
  * **Poor Network Segmentation:** Placing the graph database in a network segment accessible from less trusted environments.
  * **Not Implementing Authorization:** Granting all application users or the application service account overly broad permissions (e.g., admin rights) instead of least privilege.
  * **Lack of TLS/SSL:** Not configuring TLS for encrypting data in transit between the Go application and the Neo4j server.
  * **Building Cypher Queries with String Concatenation:** Directly embedding user input into Cypher queries in the Go application, leading to Cypher injection risks.
  * **Ignoring Security Updates:** Not keeping the Neo4j server patched against known vulnerabilities.

## Exploitation Goals

  * **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive information stored in the graph (e.g., user relationships, personal data, financial transactions).
  * **Data Tampering/Corruption:** Modifying or deleting nodes and relationships, disrupting application functionality or data integrity.
  * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwhelming the database with malicious queries or by deleting critical data.
  * **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining administrative access to the database, potentially leading to further system compromise.
  * **Application Takeover:** If the graph database stores application configuration or user session data, manipulating it could lead to application-level attacks.
  * **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised database as a stepping stone to access other internal systems.

## Affected Components or Files

  * **Neo4j Server Configuration:** Files like `neo4j.conf` (or environment variables) that control authentication, authorization, and network listeners.
  * **Golang Application Code:**
      * Database connection logic (e.g., files using `neo4j-go-driver`).
      * Code that constructs and executes Cypher queries.
      * Configuration files or environment variables in the Go application storing database credentials.
  * **Network Infrastructure:** Firewall rules, security group configurations.

## Vulnerable Code Snippet

This vulnerability primarily lies in the **database configuration** and secondarily in how the Go application **constructs queries**.

**1. Database Configuration (Illustrative - `neo4j.conf`):**

```conf
# VULNERABLE: Authentication disabled
# dbms.security.auth_enabled=false

# VULNERABLE: Default HTTP/HTTPS connectors exposed to all interfaces without firewall
# dbms.connector.http.listen_address=0.0.0.0:7474
# dbms.connector.https.listen_address=0.0.0.0:7473
# dbms.connector.bolt.listen_address=0.0.0.0:7687

# VULNERABLE: Default password for 'neo4j' user not changed (implicit)
```

**2. Golang Code Susceptible to Cypher Injection (if database auth is weak/bypassed):**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j" // Using official Neo4j Go driver
)

// Assume driver and session are initialized globally or passed around
var driver neo4j.DriverWithContext

func getUserNode(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	userName := r.URL.Query().Get("name") // User-controlled input

	// VULNERABLE: Cypher query built using string concatenation
	// If 'userName' is something like "admin' RETURN n UNION MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n; //",
	// it could lead to unintended data deletion or exposure.
	query := fmt.Sprintf("MATCH (u:User {name: '%s'}) RETURN u.email", userName)

	ctx := r.Context()
	session := driver.NewSession(ctx, neo4j.SessionConfig{AccessMode: neo4j.AccessModeRead})
	defer session.Close(ctx)

	result, err := session.Run(ctx, query, nil) // Parameters map is nil
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Database query error: %v", err), http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}

	record, err := result.Single(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Error getting record: %v", err), http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}
	email, _ := record.Get("u.email")
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "User Email: %s", email.(string))
}

func main() {
	// Example: "neo4j://localhost:7687" or "bolt://user:password@localhost:7687"
	// If this URI points to a DB with auth disabled or default/weak creds,
	// the connection itself is a risk.
	dbUri := "neo4j://localhost:7687" // Ideally load from config
	dbUser := "neo4j"                  // Default user, BAD if password is default/weak
	dbPassword := "password"           // Default/weak password, BAD!

	var err error
	driver, err = neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(dbUri, neo4j.BasicAuth(dbUser, dbPassword, ""))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create Neo4j driver: %v", err)
	}
	defer driver.Close(r.Context()) // Ensure context is available or handle differently

	http.HandleFunc("/user", getUserNode)
	log.Println("Server starting on :8090...")
	// In a real app, ensure driver and session management is robust.
	// This main function is simplified for brevity.
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8090", nil); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Server failed: %v", err)
	}
}
```

## Detection Steps

1.  **Database Configuration Review (Neo4j):**
      * Check `neo4j.conf` (or relevant environment variables/Docker configuration) for `dbms.security.auth_enabled`. It should be `true` (default) or not set (as `true` is default).
      * Verify that default users (like `neo4j`) have had their passwords changed from the initial default.
      * Inspect network bindings (`dbms.connector.bolt.listen_address`, `dbms.connector.http.listen_address`, etc.). Ensure they are not unnecessarily exposed (e.g., not `0.0.0.0` if only local access is needed).
      * Check if TLS is enabled for Bolt (`dbms.connector.bolt.tls_level=REQUIRED`) and HTTP/HTTPS.
      * Review defined users and roles for adherence to the principle of least privilege.
2.  **Network Scanning:**
      * Use tools like `nmap` to scan for open Neo4j ports (e.g., 7687, 7474, 7473) from different network vantage points (external, internal).
      * Attempt to connect using default credentials (e.g., `neo4j/neo4j`, `neo4j/password` or any known initial password for the version).
3.  **Golang Code Review:**
      * Examine how database connection strings/URIs are formed and where credentials are stored. Ensure they are not hardcoded insecurely.
      * Look for Cypher query construction. Any string concatenation involving user input is a high-risk indicator for Cypher injection. Ensure parameterized queries are used.
      * Check if the Go driver is configured to use encrypted connections (e.g., `neo4j+s://` or `bolt+s://` schemes, or driver-specific TLS options).
4.  **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** While not specific to *unsecured database configuration*, ensure the Neo4j Go driver itself is up-to-date and doesn't have known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `govulncheck`.
5.  **Penetration Testing:** Actively try to exploit weak configurations and Cypher injection vulnerabilities.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

**Scenario 1: Accessing Neo4j with Default Credentials / Authentication Disabled**

1.  **Setup:** A Neo4j instance running with authentication disabled or with the `neo4j` user having a default/known weak password (e.g., "password"). Ensure the Bolt port (7687) is accessible.
2.  **Golang Client (or any Neo4j browser/client):**
    ```go
    // Part of a Go program
    // Assumes driver is initialized with URI like "neo4j://<neo4j_host>:7687"
    // and potentially neo4j.BasicAuth("neo4j", "default_or_weak_password", "")
    // or no auth if auth is disabled on server.

    ctx := context.Background()
    session := driver.NewSession(ctx, neo4j.SessionConfig{AccessMode: neo4j.AccessModeRead})
    defer session.Close(ctx)

    result, err := session.Run(ctx, "MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) AS node_count", nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to run query: %v", err) // This will succeed if connection is made
    }
    record, err := result.Single(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to get record: %v", err)
    }
    count, _ := record.Get("node_count")
    fmt.Printf("Successfully connected and found %d nodes.\n", count.(int64))
    ```
3.  **Observation:** The Go code successfully connects and executes a query, demonstrating unauthorized/weakly authorized access. An attacker could then run queries to exfiltrate or modify data.

**Scenario 2: Cypher Injection via Golang App**

1.  **Setup:** Use the vulnerable `getUserNode` Go function from the snippet above, connected to any Neo4j instance.
2.  **Exploit:** Send a malicious HTTP request:
    ```bash
    # Simple info leak (if the user structure allows it)
    curl "http://localhost:8090/user?name=anything' RETURN properties(u); //"

    # More destructive (conceptual - exact syntax depends on DB state)
    # This attempts to match any 'User' and then tries to delete all nodes.
    # The 'u.email' part will likely fail, but the deletion might be attempted.
    curl "http://localhost:8090/user?name=x'} RETURN u.email UNION MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n; MATCH (u:User {name:'x"
    ```
3.  **Observation:** The application's response or the state of the database will change unexpectedly. Sensitive data might be returned, or data might be deleted/corrupted. The Neo4j query log would show the malicious query being executed.

## Risk Classification

  * **OWASP Top 10 (indirectly related):**
      * A01:2021 â€“ Broken Access Control (if auth/authz is weak on DB)
      * A02:2021 â€“ Cryptographic Failures (if data in transit is not encrypted)
      * A03:2021 â€“ Injection (if Cypher injection is possible via the Go app)
      * A05:2021 â€“ Security Misconfiguration (the root cause for the database)
  * **CWE:**
      * CWE-287: Improper Authentication
      * CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials (e.g. default passwords)
      * CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
      * CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
      * CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection', analogous for Cypher)
      * CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
  * **CVSS v3.1 Score:** Highly variable, often **7.5 to 9.8** (High to Critical) depending on exposure and impact. For instance, a publicly exposed Neo4j with default credentials allowing full data access would be critical.

## Fix & Patch Guidance

1.  **Database Server Hardening (Neo4j):**
      * **Enable Authentication:** Ensure `dbms.security.auth_enabled=true` in `neo4j.conf`.
      * **Change Default Passwords:** Immediately change the password for the default `neo4j` user upon setup. Use strong, unique passwords.
      * **Network Configuration:**
          * Bind Neo4j listeners (Bolt, HTTP/S) to specific IP addresses (`localhost` or internal IPs) if external access is not required (`dbms.connector.bolt.listen_address=localhost:7687`).
          * Use firewalls (e.g., `ufw`, `iptables`, cloud security groups) to restrict access to Neo4j ports only from trusted IP addresses/ranges (e.g., your Go application servers).
      * **Enable TLS:** Configure TLS for Bolt (`dbms.connector.bolt.tls_level=REQUIRED`) and HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. Use `neo4j+s` or `bolt+s` URI schemes in your Go application.
      * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Create specific roles and users for your Go application with the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., read-only if it only reads data). Avoid using the admin `neo4j` user for application connections. Consult Neo4j documentation on `CREATE ROLE`, `GRANT`, `DENY`.
      * **Regularly Update Neo4j:** Keep the Neo4j server patched to the latest version.
2.  **Golang Application Security:**
      * **Parameterized Queries:** ALWAYS use parameterized queries with the Neo4j Go driver to prevent Cypher injection. Do not construct queries using string formatting with user input.
        ```go
        // Secure way to write the query from the vulnerable snippet
        query := "MATCH (u:User {name: $userNameParam}) RETURN u.email"
        params := map[string]interface{}{"userNameParam": userName} // Parameter map
        result, err := session.Run(ctx, query, params)
        // ... rest of the code
        ```
      * **Secure Credential Management:** Store database credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables, HashiCorp Vault, or cloud provider secret managers). Do not hardcode them in the Go application.
      * **Use Encrypted Connections:** Ensure the Go driver is configured to connect to Neo4j using TLS (e.g., `neo4j+s://` or `bolt+s://` in the connection URI).
      * **Connection Pooling and Session Management:** Use driver features for efficient and secure connection handling.
      * **Input Validation:** Validate all input received from users or external sources before using it, even in parameterized queries, to enforce business rules.

## Scope and Impact

  * **Scope:**
      * The primary vulnerability lies in the configuration and security posture of the graph database server.
      * The Golang application can exacerbate the risk through insecure practices (like Cypher injection) or be an unwitting conduit to the vulnerable database.
      * Impacts any data stored within the graph database and potentially the systems/applications that rely on this data.
  * **Impact:**
      * **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to and exfiltration of potentially sensitive graph data.
      * **Data Loss/Corruption:** Malicious modification or deletion of graph data.
      * **Application Disruption/DoS:** The application relying on the graph database may become unstable or unavailable.
      * **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust due to a security incident.
      * **Compliance Violations:** Failure to protect sensitive data can lead to regulatory fines (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

## Remediation Recommendation

1.  **Audit Neo4j Configuration:** Regularly review `neo4j.conf` and security settings. Prioritize enabling authentication, changing default credentials, and network port restriction.
2.  **Implement Strong Authentication & Authorization:** Use strong, unique passwords. Create dedicated, least-privilege users for your Go applications. Utilize Neo4j's role-based access control.
3.  **Enforce Encrypted Communication:** Enable and require TLS for all client-database connections.
4.  **Secure Golang Code:**
      * Mandate the use of parameterized queries for all Cypher interactions.
      * Securely manage and inject database credentials into the application.
      * Configure the Go driver to use TLS.
5.  **Network Segmentation & Firewalls:** Restrict network access to the Neo4j database to only trusted application servers.
6.  **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct penetration tests focusing on database security and application-level injection vulnerabilities.
7.  **Security Awareness & Training:** Educate developers and operations teams on secure database practices and common pitfalls.

## Summary

Unsecured graph databases like Neo4j pose a significant threat when accessed by Golang applications (or any client). The root cause is typically misconfiguration of the database itself, such as disabled authentication, default credentials, excessive network exposure, or lack of encryption. Golang applications can worsen this by using insecure practices like Cypher query string concatenation (leading to injection). Remediation involves a defense-in-depth approach: hardening the Neo4j server (authentication, authorization, TLS, network restrictions), writing secure Go code (parameterized queries, secure credential management, TLS connections), and implementing robust network security.

    Okay, here's a report on "Unsecured Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j)" when accessed by a Golang application.

It's important to note that this vulnerability class primarily stems from the **misconfiguration of the graph database itself**, rather than a flaw inherent to Golang. However, a Golang application interacting with such an unsecured database can be the vector through which data is compromised or manipulated.
