# **Lack of Database Authentication Credentials in Golang Applications (db-auth-missing)**

## **1. Vulnerability Title**

Lack of Database Authentication Credentials in Golang Applications (db-auth-missing)

## **2. Severity Rating**

**HighðŸŸ  to CriticalðŸ”´ (CVSS:3.1 Score: 9.8)**

The absence of database authentication credentials represents a significant security vulnerability, generally classified as High to Critical. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides a standardized framework for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities. For a typical scenario where a database is network-accessible and lacks authentication, the CVSS v3.1 base score is 9.8 (Critical), derived from the vector AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

This high rating stems from the direct and often unrestricted access an attacker can gain to sensitive data and database functionalities. The "Attack Complexity: Low" (AC:L) and "Privileges Required: None" (PR:N) metrics are direct consequences of missing authentication, as connecting to an unprotected database requires minimal effort and no prior privileges. The potential for complete compromise of Confidentiality (C:H), Integrity (I:H), and Availability (A:H) further underscores the critical nature of this flaw.

While the specific CVSS score can be influenced by environmental factors, such as whether the database is only locally accessible (AV:L) which would lower the score, the common and most concerning scenario involves network-accessible databases. This report primarily addresses this higher-risk scenario. The OWASP Top 10 2021 list includes "A07:2021 â€“ Identification and Authentication Failures", which directly encompasses the failure to authenticate database access. Similarly, CWE-306: "Missing Authentication for Critical Function" is a highly relevant classification.

**CVSS Breakdown Table**

| **Metric** | **Value** | **Justification** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attack Vector (AV) | Network (N) | Assumes the database is accessible over a network, a common configuration for application databases. |
| Attack Complexity (AC) | Low (L) | If no credentials are required, establishing a connection is trivial. |
| Privileges Required (PR) | None (N) | The core of the vulnerability is the absence of any requirement for authentication. |
| User Interaction (UI) | None (N) | Attackers interact directly with the database service; no user needs to be deceived or involved. |
| Scope (S) | Unchanged (U) | The impact is primarily on the database server itself, although data exfiltration has broader consequences for the application and its users. |
| Confidentiality (C) | High (H) | All data residing within the database could be exposed to unauthorized parties. |
| Integrity (I) | High (H) | Data can be created, modified, or deleted without authorization, compromising its trustworthiness. |
| Availability (A) | High (H) | The database can be rendered unavailable through actions like data deletion, table dropping, or resource exhaustion by an unauthenticated attacker. |
| **CVSS 3.1 Base Score** | **9.8** | **(Critical)** |

The severity is not merely theoretical; it is amplified by the ease of exploitation when no credentials are required. This vulnerability often arises from misconfigurations during development or deployment, or from an incorrect assumption that network-level security alone is sufficient to protect database resources.

## **3. Description**

This vulnerability, 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' (db-auth-missing), occurs when a Golang application establishes a connection to a database system (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, or others) without utilizing or enforcing any authentication credentials. This typically means that connection strings or configuration parameters for username, password, security tokens, or client certificates are either absent, empty, or contain default/weak values that the database server is configured to accept without proper validation.

The consequence of this vulnerability is that any entity capable of network access to the database service can potentially gain unauthorized entry. This allows for unfettered access to the data stored within and the functionalities offered by the database management system. It is a fundamental security flaw that undermines the primary defense layer of a database. This type of weakness is frequently categorized under OWASP A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures, which pertains to failures in confirming user identity, and A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration, where systems are not securely configured.

The problem is not inherently specific to the Go language itself, but rather manifests in how Golang applications are developed and configured to interact with database systems. This can be due to an application-level misconfiguration, where the Go code or its associated configuration files fail to supply necessary credentials. Alternatively, it can stem from a database-level misconfiguration, where the database server itself is set up to not require authentication for certain connections or from certain hosts. For example, a PostgreSQL server might be configured with `trust` authentication in its `pg_hba.conf` file, or a MySQL server might permit connections for users with empty passwords. In either case, the Golang application becomes a party to this insecure interaction, potentially connecting without credentials and operating on a compromised security footing. Such vulnerabilities often arise from overlooking secure coding conventions, leading to exposed systems.

## **4. Technical Description (for security pros)**

The technical underpinnings of the 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' vulnerability in Golang applications involve the interaction between the application's database connection logic, the specific database driver being used, and the authentication mechanisms configured on the database server.

Connection Strings (DSNs) and Driver Behavior:

Golang applications typically utilize the standard database/sql package as an abstraction layer for database interactions, in conjunction with third-party database-specific drivers.11 Connections are commonly initiated using a Data Source Name (DSN). If this DSN is constructed or supplied to the sql.Open() function without the necessary authentication parameters (e.g., username, password), and the target database server is configured to permit such connections, the vulnerability is realized.

For instance:

- A PostgreSQL DSN might omit `user` and `password` parameters (e.g., `host=localhost port=5432 dbname=mydb sslmode=disable`), relying on a permissive `pg_hba.conf` setting like `trust` authentication for the connecting host/user.
    
- A MySQL DSN, often formatted using the `mysql.Config` struct from the `go-sql-driver/mysql` package, might have empty `User` and `Passwd` fields. If the MySQL server has a user account configured with no password (e.g., `'root'@'localhost'` without a password, or an application user `'appuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY ''`), a connection may be established. The `go-sql-driver/mysql` has exhibited behavior where an empty password field in the configuration might lead to an attempt to authenticate with an empty password, which some MySQL configurations accept.

- Microsoft SQL Server connections via `go-mssqldb` also rely on DSNs where missing `user id` or `password` parameters can lead to unauthenticated access if the SQL Server is configured for Windows Authentication and the application runs under an identity permitted to connect, or if SQL authentication is enabled with users having blank passwords.
    
The `database/sql` package itself does not handle authentication; this is delegated to the specific driver. Nuances in how these drivers parse DSNs or their default behaviors when credentials are partially or wholly missing are critical. If a driver attempts a connection without credentials (or with empty ones) and the database server accepts this attempt, the vulnerability is active.

Database Server Configuration:

The Golang application's ability to connect without authentication is critically dependent on the database server's configuration:

- **PostgreSQL:** The `pg_hba.conf` file is central. Entries specifying the `trust` authentication method for a given host, database, and user combination allow connections without a password.
- **MySQL:** User accounts can be created with no password, or with plugins like `auth_socket` (for local Unix socket connections) that might bypass password checks if misconfigured. Older versions might allow connections for users with empty passwords using the `mysql_native_password` plugin.
    
- **MongoDB:** Older versions of MongoDB, if not started with `-auth` or if security.authorization is disabled in the configuration file, would allow unauthenticated access by default.

Environment and Configuration Mismanagement:

A common scenario involves development or testing environments where authentication is relaxed for convenience. If these insecure configurations (e.g., environment variables for database passwords left blank, or DSNs in configuration files lacking credentials) are inadvertently promoted to staging or production environments, or if these environments become unexpectedly exposed, the vulnerability surfaces.

This vulnerability is particularly insidious in microservice architectures or containerized deployments. Internal services might be erroneously assumed to operate within a "trusted" network perimeter, leading developers to omit authentication for inter-service database connections to simplify deployment or reduce latency. If one such service is compromised, it can serve as a stepping stone for the attacker to access any database it connects to without credentials, thereby traversing the internal network.

## **5. Common Mistakes That Cause This**

The 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' vulnerability in Golang applications often arises from a series of common mistakes made during development, deployment, or database administration. These errors typically stem from a misunderstanding of security principles, development shortcuts, or misconfiguration.

1. **Reliance on Default Configurations:** Database systems may ship with default user accounts that have empty, well-known, or weak passwords (e.g., 'root' with no password in older MySQL versions). Golang applications configured to use these default credentials effectively connect without meaningful authentication.
    
2. **Development Shortcuts Promoted to Production:** In development environments, developers frequently configure databases for password-less access to streamline setup and testing (e.g., PostgreSQL `trust` authentication for local connections, MySQL root user without a password). A critical mistake occurs when this insecure configuration is not hardened before deployment to staging or production environments, or when connection strings used in development (lacking credentials) are mistakenly used in production. This "it works on my machine" approach, without a distinct, secure production configuration, is a primary contributor.
    
3. **Incorrect DSN or Connection Configuration Construction:** Golang applications may programmatically construct DSNs or use configuration objects (like `mysql.Config`). If these processes fail to include credential components (username, password), or if they allow empty strings for these fields and the database accepts such connections, the vulnerability is introduced. This can happen due to coding errors, missing configuration values, or faulty logic in configuration loading.
    
4. **Ignoring or Misunderstanding Driver-Specific Behavior:** Different Golang database drivers might have unique ways of handling DSNs or defaulting authentication methods when parameters are absent. For example, a driver might attempt an anonymous connection or use default OS credentials if not explicitly told otherwise. Failure to consult and understand driver documentation can lead to unexpected unauthenticated connections.
    
5. **Misinterpretation of `database/sql` Abstraction:** Developers might incorrectly assume that the `database/sql` package in Go handles all security aspects, including enforcing authentication. However, `database/sql` is an interface, and the actual connection and authentication are managed by the specific driver and its DSN interpretation.
    
6. **Over-reliance on Network Segmentation:** A prevalent mistake is assuming that because a database server is on an "internal" or "private" network, it does not require strong authentication. This neglects the principle of defense-in-depth. If the network perimeter is breached or an internal application is compromised, the unauthenticated database becomes an easy target.
    
7. **Permissive Database Server Authentication Rules:** Database administrators might configure overly permissive rules. In PostgreSQL, incorrect use of `trust` in `pg_hba.conf` is a classic example. In MySQL, creating users with `IDENTIFIED BY ''` (empty password) or granting privileges to wildcard hosts (`%`) for users without passwords leads to this state.
8. **Empty or Missing Credentials in Configuration Sources:** When Golang applications are designed to load credentials from external sources like configuration files (e.g., `config.json`, `.env`) or environment variables, these sources might be improperly managed. For instance, a `DB_PASSWORD` environment variable might be unset or set to an empty string in a deployment environment. The application logic might not adequately validate that these credentials are non-empty before attempting a connection.

9. **Abstraction by ORMs or Higher-Level Libraries:** Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) or other database utility libraries built on top of `database/sql` can sometimes obscure the underlying connection details. If these tools are not configured correctly with authentication parameters, or if their default configurations are insecure and used without modification, they can inadvertently lead to connections without credentials. The abstraction layer might make it less obvious that authentication is missing compared to manually crafting a DSN.

Addressing these common mistakes requires a combination of secure coding practices, rigorous configuration management, and a security-aware development culture.

## **6. Exploitation Goals**

Attackers who successfully exploit a 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' vulnerability in a Golang application, or by directly accessing the misconfigured database, typically pursue several malicious objectives. The ultimate goal is to leverage the unauthorized access for gain, disruption, or further compromise.

Common exploitation goals include:

1. **Data Exfiltration:** This is often the primary objective. Attackers aim to steal sensitive information stored within the database. This can include Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data (credit card numbers, bank account details), healthcare records (PHI), intellectual property, proprietary business logic, or user credentials that might be stored (hopefully hashed and salted) within the database.
    
2. **Data Tampering/Modification:** Attackers may alter existing data to commit fraud, disrupt business operations, spread misinformation, or damage the victim's reputation. Examples include modifying financial records, changing user account details, or altering critical application settings stored in the database.
    
3. **Data Deletion/Destruction:** Malicious actors might delete entire databases, specific tables, or critical records to cause significant disruption, denial of service, or permanent data loss. This can be done for sabotage or as part of a ransomware attack where data is first exfiltrated then deleted.
    
4. **Privilege Escalation:** If the database connection established without authentication grants high privileges (e.g., connecting as a database superuser like `postgres`, `root`, or `dbo`), attackers can escalate their privileges. This might involve creating new database users with administrative rights, modifying database server configurations, or, in some database systems, executing operating system commands through built-in database functions (e.g., `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server, or using `COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM` in PostgreSQL if appropriately privileged).
    
5. **Lateral Movement and Network Pivoting:** A compromised database server can serve as a foothold within the victim's internal network. Attackers might use the compromised server to scan for other vulnerable systems, launch attacks against other internal resources, or exfiltrate data from other connected systems.
6. **Service Disruption (Denial of Service):** Beyond data deletion, attackers can cause a denial of service by overwhelming the database with resource-intensive queries, locking critical tables, exhausting connection pools, or manipulating data in a way that causes the Golang application or other dependent services to fail.
7. **Installation of Malware/Ransomware:** If the attacker achieves OS command execution capabilities through the compromised database (via privilege escalation), they could attempt to install malware, ransomware, or cryptominers on the database server or connected systems.
8. **Establishing Persistence:** Attackers may create new, hidden database accounts, schedule malicious jobs within the database, or plant triggers that execute malicious code. This allows them to maintain access even if the initial vulnerability (lack of authentication) is remediated.

The specific goals will vary based on the attacker's motivation and the nature of the data and systems accessible through the compromised database. The impact is dictated by the sensitivity of the data and the level of privilege afforded by the unauthenticated connection. Even a read-only unauthenticated access can be highly damaging if the data is sensitive.

## **7. Affected Components or Files**

The 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' vulnerability involves several components across the Golang application stack and the database infrastructure. A comprehensive understanding of these components is crucial for effective detection and remediation.

**Golang Application Components:**

1. **`database/sql` Package:** As the standard Go library interface for SQL database operations, any code utilizing `sql.Open()` to establish database connections is a primary area of concern.
    
2. **Specific Database Drivers:** The actual implementation of connection and authentication logic resides within the database-specific drivers. Vulnerable configurations often involve improper use of these drivers:
    - `github.com/lib/pq` (for PostgreSQL)
        
    - `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` (for MySQL)
        
    - `github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb` (for Microsoft SQL Server)
        
    - Drivers for NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis) if they are used with connection strings or configurations that permit unauthenticated access.
3. **Configuration Files:** External files from which the Golang application sources its database connection strings or parameters. If these files contain empty, default, or missing credentials, they contribute to the vulnerability. Common formats include:
    - `.env` files
    - `config.json`, `config.yaml`, `config.toml`
    - Custom configuration file formats.
        
4. **Environment Variables:** If DSNs or individual credential components (host, port, user, password, database name) are supplied via environment variables, unset or empty variables (e.g., `DB_PASSWORD=""`) can lead to connection attempts without proper authentication.
    
5. **Application Code:** Specific modules, functions, or structs within the Golang application responsible for:
    - Initializing and managing database connection pools.
    - Dynamically constructing DSNs.
    - Loading and parsing database configurations.
    - Any ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) or database utility library configuration code.

**Database Server Components:**

1. **Database Server Configuration Files:** These files dictate the authentication methods, allowed hosts, and user policies on the server side.
    - **PostgreSQL:** `pg_hba.conf` (Host-Based Authentication rules, e.g., `trust` entries), `postgresql.conf` (network listening addresses).
    - **MySQL:** `my.cnf` or `my.ini` (server settings, authentication plugin configurations), internal grant tables (`mysql.user`, `mysql.db`).
    - **SQL Server:** SQL Server Configuration Manager settings, login properties, contained database settings.
    - **MongoDB:** `mongod.conf` (security.authorization settings).
2. **Database User Accounts and Privileges:** The definition of user accounts within the database, specifically those with empty passwords, default passwords, or overly permissive host access specifications (e.g., MySQL user `'app_user'@'%'` with no password).

**Infrastructure and Deployment Components:**

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Templates:** Scripts used for automated provisioning of infrastructure (e.g., Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager templates, Kubernetes YAML). If these templates define database instances with insecure default authentication settings (e.g., no master password, overly permissive network rules, default users with known credentials), they are an affected component.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline Configurations:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline scripts or configurations that inject connection strings or credentials into application environments. If these pipelines use insecure defaults or fail to populate credentials for certain environments, they contribute to the vulnerability.
3. **Containerization Configuration:** Dockerfiles or container orchestration platform configurations (e.g., Kubernetes Deployments, Docker Compose files) that define environment variables or mount configuration files with missing or empty database credentials.

A thorough audit for this vulnerability must consider both the application-side (Golang code, configurations) and the server-side (database configuration, user accounts), as well as the infrastructure provisioning and deployment mechanisms. A weakness in any of these areas can lead to or enable unauthenticated database access.

## **8. Vulnerable Code Snippet**

The following code snippets illustrate how a Golang application might connect to a database without enforcing authentication, thereby exhibiting the 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' vulnerability. These examples assume that the respective database server is configured to allow such connections.

**PostgreSQL Example (using `github.com/lib/pq`)**

This snippet demonstrates connecting to a PostgreSQL database where the DSN (Data Source Name) omits user and password information. This code would successfully connect if the PostgreSQL server's `pg_hba.conf` is configured with a `trust` authentication method for the connecting host and database, or if environment variables like `PGUSER` and `PGPASSWORD` are not set and the driver/database defaults to a permissive connection.

```Go

package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	_ "github.com/lib/pq" // PostgreSQL driver
)

const (
	dbHost   = "localhost"
	dbPort   = 5432
	dbName   = "mydb"
	// dbUser and dbPassword are intentionally omitted
)

func main() {
	// Vulnerable DSN: Missing user and password.
	// Relies on permissive server-side authentication (e.g., 'trust' in pg_hba.conf).
	psqlInfo := fmt.Sprintf("host=%s port=%d dbname=%s sslmode=disable",
		dbHost, dbPort, dbName)

	db, err := sql.Open("postgres", psqlInfo)
	if err!= nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error opening database connection: %v", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	// Ping the database to verify the connection.
	// If this succeeds without credentials, it confirms the vulnerability.
	err = db.Ping()
	if err!= nil {
		// If Ping fails with an authentication error, the DB is likely secure against this attempt.
		// However, the application might still be misconfigured if it was intended to use credentials.
		log.Fatalf("Error connecting to database (ping failed): %v", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Successfully connected to PostgreSQL (potentially without authentication)!")
		// At this point, an attacker could perform operations if the connection has privileges.
		// Example: rows, err := db.Query("SELECT version();")
	}

	//... further database operations would proceed with this potentially unauthenticated connection
}
```

Corresponding Insecure PostgreSQL Setup (Conceptual):

In pg_hba.conf:

host mydb all 127.0.0.1/32 trust

Or, for broader access (more insecure):

host all all 0.0.0.0/0 trust

**MySQL Example (using `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`)**

This snippet shows a connection to MySQL where the `mysql.Config` struct is used with empty `User` and `Passwd` fields. This can lead to a successful unauthenticated connection if the MySQL server has a user account configured with an empty password (e.g., `'root'@'localhost'` or an application-specific user `'appuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY ''`).

```Go

package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" // MySQL driver
)

const (
	dbHost   = "127.0.0.1"
	dbPort   = "3306"
	dbName   = "mydb"
	// User and Passwd are intentionally left empty in the config
)

func main() {
	// Vulnerable configuration: User and Passwd fields are empty.
	// Relies on MySQL server allowing users with empty passwords or anonymous access.
	cfg := mysql.Config{
		User:   "", // Intentionally empty or omitted
		Passwd: "", // Intentionally empty
		Net:    "tcp",
		Addr:   fmt.Sprintf("%s:%s", dbHost, dbPort),
		DBName: dbName,
		// For some MySQL versions/configurations, AllowNativePasswords might be relevant
		// when dealing with older password hashing methods or empty passwords.
		// AllowNativePasswords: true,
	}

	db, err := sql.Open("mysql", cfg.FormatDSN())
	if err!= nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error opening database connection: %v", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	// Ping the database to verify the connection.
	err = db.Ping()
	if err!= nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error connecting to database (ping failed): %v", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Successfully connected to MySQL (potentially without authentication)!")
		// Example: _, err := db.Exec("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id INT);")
	}

	//... further database operations
}
```

Corresponding Insecure MySQL Setup (Conceptual):

Execute SQL commands in MySQL:

CREATE USER 'appuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mydb.* TO 'appuser'@'%';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Or, for the root user (highly discouraged for production):

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '';

In both examples, the vulnerability lies in the *omission* of credentials in the Go application's connection logic, coupled with a permissive database server configuration that *accepts* such connections. The `db.Ping()` call is significant: if it succeeds under these conditions, it confirms that an unauthenticated (or weakly authenticated) session has been established. If `Ping()` were to fail with an authentication-specific error (e.g., "password authentication failed for user..."), it would indicate that the database server is, in fact, requiring authentication, thereby preventing this specific instance of the vulnerability, though the application might still be misconfigured if it was intended to provide credentials.

## **9. Detection Steps**

Detecting the 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' vulnerability requires a comprehensive approach, examining both the Golang application code and the configuration of the database server(s) it interacts with.

**1. Manual Code Review (Golang Application):**

- **Connection Logic:** Scrutinize all parts of the Go codebase where database connections are initiated. This primarily involves looking for calls to `sql.Open()` and how the DSN (Data Source Name) or connection configuration object is constructed.
    
- **DSN Analysis:**
    - Check if username and password parameters are consistently present in DSN strings or configuration structs (e.g., `user=`, `password=` for DSN strings; `User`, `Passwd` fields in `mysql.Config` ).
        
    - Verify that these parameters are not hardcoded with empty values or weak default credentials.
    - If DSNs are built dynamically, trace the origin of each component (host, port, user, password, dbname) to ensure credentials are not lost or empty.
- **Configuration Loading:** Analyze how database credentials are loaded (e.g., from environment variables, configuration files like `.json`, `.yaml`, `.env`).
    - Ensure that there are checks for empty or missing credential values after loading.
    - Verify default values in configuration templates are not insecure.

- **Driver-Specifics:** Be aware of default behaviors of the specific database drivers used (e.g., `lib/pq` for PostgreSQL , `go-sql-driver/mysql` for MySQL ). Some drivers might have fallbacks or specific interpretations of missing DSN parameters.

**2. Database Server Configuration Review:**

This is crucial as the vulnerability often manifests due to permissive server-side settings.

- **PostgreSQL:**
    - Inspect `pg_hba.conf`: Look for `trust` authentication method entries, especially for network connections (`host` type lines). Scrutinize entries that allow connections from broad IP ranges (e.g., `0.0.0.0/0`) or for critical users without requiring a password.
    - Check `postgresql.conf` for `listen_addresses` to understand network exposure.
- **MySQL:**
    - Query the `mysql.user` table: `SELECT user, host, plugin, authentication_string FROM mysql.user;`
    - Look for users with empty `authentication_string` (password) fields.
    - Identify users where the `plugin` might allow passwordless login (e.g., `auth_socket` if misconfigured for network users, or if `mysql_native_password` is used with an empty password string).
        
    - Check `bind-address` in `my.cnf` to determine network exposure.
- **Other Databases (SQL Server, MongoDB, etc.):**
    - Review equivalent authentication configuration files and user account settings (e.g., SQL Server security logins, MongoDB user roles and authentication mechanisms).

**3. Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**

- Employ SAST tools capable of analyzing Golang code. Configure them to:
    - Trace data flow from configuration sources (files, environment variables) to database connection functions.
    - Flag instances where DSNs are constructed without credential components or with hardcoded empty credentials.
    - Some SAST tools might have specific rules for detecting insecure database connection patterns. For example, a pattern similar to detecting `DriverManager.getConnection($URI, $USR, "");` in Java could be adapted for Go's `sql.Open` with incomplete DSNs.
        
    - While `go-security/grpc-client-insecure` targets gRPC's `grpc.WithInsecure()` , analogous rules for database connections are desirable.
        

**4. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) / Penetration Testing:**

- **Direct Database Connection Attempts:** From the network segments where the application server resides (or from any accessible network if the DB is broadly exposed), attempt to connect to the database service using standard database client tools (e.g., `psql`, `mysql`, `sqlcmd`, `mongo`).
    - Try connecting without providing any username or password.
    - Try connecting with common default usernames (e.g., `root`, `admin`, `postgres`, `sa`) and empty passwords.
    - Attempt to use application-specific usernames (if known) with empty passwords.
- **Application Interaction Monitoring (Advanced):** If direct database access is restricted, interact with the Golang application's exposed functionality. Monitor network traffic between the application and the database (if possible and unencrypted) or use application logs (if detailed enough) to infer if connections are being made without authentication. This is generally more complex.

**5. Network Scanning and Service Enumeration:**

- Use network scanners (e.g., Nmap) to identify open database ports (e.g., 5432/tcp for PostgreSQL, 3306/tcp for MySQL, 1433/tcp for SQL Server, 27017/tcp for MongoDB).
- Some scanning scripts can attempt basic authentication probes, including null or default credential checks.

**6. Environment and Configuration Audits:**

- Verify the actual runtime environment of the Golang application. Check loaded environment variables in deployed instances (e.g., Kubernetes pods, VM environments) to ensure `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, etc., are set and non-empty.
- Audit Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates (Terraform, CloudFormation) and CI/CD deployment scripts for insecure default database configurations or credential handling.

Effective detection requires a holistic view, combining analysis of the Golang application's code and runtime environment with a thorough audit of the database server's security posture. Relying solely on application code scanning may miss critical server-side misconfigurations that enable this vulnerability.

## **10. Proof of Concept (PoC)**

This Proof of Concept demonstrates how the 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' vulnerability can be exploited. The scenario involves a Golang application connecting to a PostgreSQL database that has been misconfigured to allow `trust` authentication.

**Scenario:**

- A Golang application needs to access a PostgreSQL database named `mydb`.
- The PostgreSQL server is configured to `trust` connections to `mydb` from the application server's IP address (or `localhost` if running on the same machine).
- The Golang application's DSN (Data Source Name) omits username and password, relying on this `trust` setting.

**Step 1: Setup Insecure PostgreSQL Server**

1. Modify pg_hba.conf:
    
    On the PostgreSQL server, locate the pg_hba.conf file (its location varies by OS and PostgreSQL version, often in the PostgreSQL data directory). Add or modify a line to allow trust authentication. For this PoC, assume the application and attacker are on the same machine as the database, or the application server has IP 192.168.1.100.
    
    If connecting from `localhost`:
    
    ```# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
    host    mydb            all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
    host    mydb            all             ::1/128                 trust`
    
    If connecting from a specific application server IP `192.168.1.100`:
    
    `# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
    host    mydb            all             192.168.1.100/32        trust
    ```
    
    **Caution:** Using `0.0.0.0/0` with `trust` is extremely dangerous and makes the database accessible to anyone on the network without a password.
    
2. Reload PostgreSQL Configuration:
    
    After saving changes to pg_hba.conf, reload the PostgreSQL configuration. This can usually be done via SQL:
    
    SELECT pg_reload_conf();
    
    Or by restarting the PostgreSQL service.
    
3. Ensure Database and Table Exist (Optional for PoC):
    
    For a more complete PoC, create the database and a sample table:
    
    ```SQL
    
    `CREATE DATABASE mydb;
    -- Connect to mydb
    \c mydb
    CREATE TABLE employees (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100));
    INSERT INTO employees (name) VALUES ('Alice'), ('Bob');
    ```
    

**Step 2: Vulnerable Golang Application Code**

Use the vulnerable Golang code snippet for PostgreSQL from Section 8. Save it as `main.go`:

```Go

package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	_ "github.com/lib/pq" // PostgreSQL driver
)

const (
	dbHost   = "localhost" // Or the IP of your PostgreSQL server
	dbPort   = 5432
	dbName   = "mydb"
)

func main() {
	psqlInfo := fmt.Sprintf("host=%s port=%d dbname=%s sslmode=disable",
		dbHost, dbPort, dbName) // DSN without user/password

	db, err := sql.Open("postgres", psqlInfo)
	if err!= nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error opening database: %v", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	err = db.Ping()
	if err!= nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error connecting to database: %v", err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Golang app successfully connected to PostgreSQL without credentials!")

	// Attempt to query data
	rows, err := db.Query("SELECT id, name FROM employees;")
	if err!= nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error querying data: %v", err)
	}
	defer rows.Close()

	fmt.Println("Employees:")
	for rows.Next() {
		var id int
		var name string
		if err := rows.Scan(&id, &name); err!= nil {
			log.Fatalf("Error scanning row: %v", err)
		}
		fmt.Printf("ID: %d, Name: %s\n", id, name)
	}
	if err := rows.Err(); err!= nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error after iterating rows: %v", err)
	}
}
```

Compile and run this application:

go run main.go

**Expected Output from Golang Application:**

```Golang app successfully connected to PostgreSQL without credentials!
Employees:
ID: 1, Name: Alice
ID: 2, Name: Bob
```

This output confirms the Golang application connected and queried data without providing explicit credentials.

**Step 3: Exploitation**

An attacker who gains access to a machine allowed by the `trust` rule in `pg_hba.conf` (e.g., the application server itself, or any machine if `0.0.0.0/0 trust` was used), or who can route traffic through such a machine, can directly connect to the database.

1. Using psql client:
    
    Open a terminal on the authorized machine (or any machine if access is wide open) and run:
    
    psql -h <db_host_ip_or_localhost> -U anyuser -d mydb
    
    (The username anyuser can often be arbitrary when trust authentication is used for all users, though sometimes specifying a valid database user that exists, even if password is not checked, might be required depending on the exact pg_hba.conf line).
    
2. Execute Queries:
    
    Once connected, the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries with the privileges of the user PostgreSQL maps the connection to (often the OS user if peer auth is also inadvertently enabled, or a default PostgreSQL user if trust is broadly configured).
    
    ```SQL
    
    `psql (PostgreSQL version)
    Type "help" for help.
    
    mydb=> SELECT * FROM employees;
     id | name
    ----+-------
      1 | Alice
      2 | Bob
    (2 rows)
    
    mydb=> -- Attacker can attempt malicious actions:
    mydb=> -- DROP TABLE employees;
    mydb=> -- SELECT pg_read_file('/etc/passwd'); (if privileges allow)
    ```
    

Conclusion of PoC:

This PoC demonstrates that the combination of a permissive trust authentication setting on the PostgreSQL server and a Golang application connecting with a DSN lacking explicit credentials leads to unauthorized database access. An attacker, fulfilling the conditions of the trust rule, can directly interact with the database, bypassing any intended application-layer controls. The "exploit" is the direct connection facilitated by the missing authentication requirement. This highlights that the vulnerability often arises from a synergy of misconfigurations in both the application connection logic and the database server's security settings.

## **11. Risk Classification**

The 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' vulnerability in Golang applications carries a typically High to Critical risk. This assessment is based on the potential impact of unauthorized database access and the likelihood of such vulnerabilities occurring due to common misconfigurations.

**Likelihood:**

The likelihood of this vulnerability can range from **Low to High**:

- **High:** This is often the case due to:
    - Insecure default configurations in some database systems (e.g., older MySQL versions allowing root login without a password from localhost, or PostgreSQL's `ident` or `peer` authentication for local connections sometimes being misunderstood or overly trusted).
    - The common practice of using `trust` authentication in PostgreSQL during development, which might accidentally persist into less secure environments.
    - Developers frequently using password-less database access in local development environments, and these configurations being inadvertently deployed.
- **Medium:** If the vulnerability requires a specific, less common misconfiguration but one that is still plausible (e.g., an administrator explicitly creating an application user with an empty password on a production system).
- **Low:** If exploiting the vulnerability requires a complex chain of events or highly specific, non-default misconfigurations on both the application and database side.

However, given the prevalence of development shortcuts and configuration errors, a Medium to High likelihood is a reasonable general assessment.

**Impact:**

The impact of exploitation is consistently **High to Critical**:

- **Confidentiality:** Complete loss of data confidentiality. All data within the database, including sensitive PII, financial details, intellectual property, and potentially other credentials, can be exfiltrated.
    
- **Integrity:** Full compromise of data integrity. Attackers can create, modify, or delete any data, leading to data corruption, financial fraud, and falsification of records.
    
- **Availability:** Total loss of database availability. Attackers can delete data, drop tables, corrupt the database structure, or exhaust server resources, rendering the application and associated services unusable.
    

The overall risk is therefore typically **High to Critical**. The risk is amplified if the database contains highly sensitive information or if the unauthenticated connection grants extensive privileges (e.g., DDL rights, superuser access). This vulnerability is a classic example of how a seemingly "simple" misconfigurationâ€”omitting a password or setting a database to `trust` connectionsâ€”can lead to disproportionately severe consequences, underscoring the paramount importance of fundamental security controls.

**CWE and OWASP Mapping:**

This vulnerability aligns with several industry-standard classifications:

| **Classification System** | **ID** | **Name** | **Relevance to db-auth-missing** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CWE | CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | Directly describes connecting to a database (a critical function) without any authentication. This is the primary CWE classification. |
| CWE | CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | A broader category; the lack of any authentication is a fundamental form of improper authentication. |
| CWE | CWE-521 | Weak Password Requirements | Applicable if an empty password (allowed by the database) is considered an instance of an extremely weak password. |
| CWE | CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | Relevant if an empty string is hardcoded as a password in the application, or if default empty credentials are used. |
| OWASP Top 10 2021 | A07:2021 | Identification and Authentication Failures | The system fails to correctly identify or authenticate the entity attempting to access the database, which is a core aspect of this vulnerability. |
| OWASP Top 10 2021 | A05:2021 | Security Misconfiguration | Allowing unauthenticated access to a database is a severe security misconfiguration, either at the application connection level or the database server level. |
| OWASP Proactive Controls | C3: Secure Database Access (2018/2024) | Secure Database Access | This vulnerability directly violates the core principles of secure database authentication and configuration advocated by this control. Implementing strong authentication is a key recommendation of C3. |

This mapping helps in contextualizing the vulnerability within established security frameworks, aiding in risk communication, prioritization, and the adoption of recognized best practices for mitigation. The vulnerability often co-occurs with or is enabled by other weaknesses, such as insecure defaults in database software or overly permissive network configurations, creating a "weakest link" scenario where multiple misconfigurations align to permit an exploit.

## **12. Fix & Patch Guidance**

Addressing the 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' vulnerability requires a multi-layered approach, focusing on securing the Golang application's connection logic and hardening the database server's authentication mechanisms. The goal is to ensure that all database access is authenticated using strong credentials and that connections are made securely.

**1. Enforce Strong, Unique Credentials for Database Accounts:**

- **Action:** Every database user account, particularly those utilized by Golang applications, must be configured with a strong, unique password. Alternatively, more robust authentication mechanisms like client certificates (mTLS), IAM-based authentication (for cloud-managed databases like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database), or Kerberos should be employed.
- **Details:** Avoid using default or easily guessable passwords. Empty passwords must be strictly prohibited for any user account that can be accessed over the network. Password policies should enforce complexity and length.
    
- **Golang Implication:** The Golang application must be configured to use these strong credentials.

**2. Proper DSN Configuration in Golang Applications:**

- **Action:** Ensure that Data Source Names (DSNs) or connection configuration objects in Golang code always include valid, non-empty parameters for username and password (or equivalent authentication tokens/mechanisms).
- **Example (PostgreSQL with `lib/pq`):**
This example is inspired by DSN structures shown in  but emphasizes the inclusion of user/password and secure SSL mode.

    ```Go
    // Secure DSN construction
    dbUser := os.Getenv("DB_USER")
    dbPassword := os.Getenv("DB_PASSWORD") // Fetched from a secure source
    //... (validate dbUser and dbPassword are not empty)
    psqlInfo := fmt.Sprintf("host=%s port=%d user=%s password=%s dbname=%s sslmode=require",
        dbHost, dbPort, dbUser, dbPassword, dbName)
    db, err := sql.Open("postgres", psqlInfo)
    ```
    
- **Example (MySQL with `go-sql-driver/mysql`):**
This reflects the structure in  but ensures `User` and `Passwd` are populated.

    ```Go
    
    // Secure mysql.Config usage
    cfg := mysql.Config{
        User:   os.Getenv("DB_USER"),
        Passwd: os.Getenv("DB_PASSWORD"), // Fetched from a secure source
        Net:    "tcp",
        Addr:   "127.0.0.1:3306",
        DBName: "mydb",
        TLSConfig: "true", // Or a custom tls.Config for stricter validation
    }
    db, err := sql.Open("mysql", cfg.FormatDSN())
    ```
    

**3. Secure Credential Management:**

- **Action:** Credentials must never be hardcoded directly into Golang source code.
    
- **Methods:**
    - **Environment Variables:** Store credentials in environment variables, which are then read by the Golang application at runtime. This is a common practice, especially in containerized environments. Ensure the environment itself (e.g., the host, container orchestration platform) is secured.

    - **Secrets Management Systems:** For production and sensitive environments, utilize dedicated secrets management solutions such as HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager. The Golang application should be configured with appropriate permissions to fetch credentials from these services at startup or per connection pool.
        
    - **Encrypted Configuration Files:** If configuration files are used, credentials within them should be encrypted, and the decryption key managed securely (e.g., via a secrets manager or environment variable). File permissions for configuration files must be strictly limited.
- **Credential Rotation:** Implement regular credential rotation policies, especially for application service accounts. Secrets management systems often provide automated rotation capabilities.

**4. Database Server Hardening:**

- **PostgreSQL:**
    - Edit `pg_hba.conf` to replace `trust` authentication with `scram-sha-256` (preferred) or `md5` for all network connections. `scram-sha-256` provides stronger protection against password sniffing and replay attacks.
    - Example `pg_hba.conf` entry: `host mydb appuser <app_server_ip>/32 scram-sha-256`
- **MySQL:**
    - Ensure all user accounts have non-empty passwords. Use `ALTER USER... IDENTIFIED BY 'new_strong_password';`.
    - Utilize modern authentication plugins like `caching_sha2_password` instead of older, weaker ones.
    - Avoid granting privileges to users with wildcard hosts (`%`) unless strictly necessary and combined with strong passwords. Limit `appuser` to connect only from the application server's IP address: `CREATE USER 'appuser'@'app_server_ip' IDENTIFIED BY 'strong_password';`.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** The database user account utilized by the Golang application should only be granted the minimum set of permissions required for its operations (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` on specific tables/views, `EXECUTE` on specific stored procedures). It should not have administrative rights like `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`, or superuser privileges.

**5. Secure Communication (TLS/SSL):**

- **Action:** Always encrypt data in transit between the Golang application and the database server using TLS/SSL.
- **Golang:** Ensure the database driver is configured to require/verify TLS. For PostgreSQL (`lib/pq`), use `sslmode=require` (to ensure encryption) or `sslmode=verify-full` (to ensure encryption and verify server certificate against a CA and hostname) in the DSN. For MySQL (`go-sql-driver/mysql`), set `tls=true` or provide a custom `tls.Config` in the DSN or `mysql.Config`.
    
- **Database Server:** Configure the database server to support and, ideally, require TLS connections. This involves setting up server certificates and keys.
Reference general TLS security practices to avoid insecure configurations like using deprecated TLS versions or weak cipher suites.

**6. Regular Audits and Testing:**

- **Code Reviews:** Incorporate checks for secure database connection patterns and credential handling into peer code review processes.
- **SAST/DAST:** Regularly scan Golang code with SAST tools configured to detect missing or weak authentication in database connection logic. Use DAST tools and penetration testing to attempt unauthenticated access to databases in deployed environments.
- **Configuration Audits:** Periodically audit database server configurations (`pg_hba.conf`, MySQL grants, etc.) and application deployment configurations (environment variables, mounted secrets) to ensure compliance with security policies.

**7. Developer Training:**

- Educate developers on the risks associated with insecure database authentication and the best practices for secure credential management and DSN configuration in Golang.
    

Fixing this vulnerability is a collaborative effort involving developers, database administrators, and security teams. The choice of credential management strategy (environment variables, configuration files, or dedicated secrets managers) will depend on the application's deployment environment and the organization's operational maturity, with secrets managers being the most robust solution for production systems. The core principle remains: the Golang application must actively provide strong credentials, and the database server must rigorously validate them.

## **13. Scope and Impact**

The 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' vulnerability has a broad scope and can lead to severe impacts on an organization's data, operations, and reputation. The extent of the damage is directly proportional to the sensitivity of the data stored in the unprotected database and the privileges granted to the unauthenticated connection.

**Scope:**

- **Affected Systems:** The primary system affected is the database server itself. However, the scope extends to the Golang application that connects to it, as its data integrity and functionality depend on the database. Any other applications or services that rely on the same compromised database are also within scope.
- **Data Scope:** All data residing within the accessible database is at risk. This includes:
    - **User Data:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers.
    - **Authentication Credentials:** Usernames, hashed passwords (which could be subject to offline cracking if weak), API keys, session tokens if stored in the database.
    - **Financial Data:** Credit card numbers, bank account details, transaction histories.
    - **Healthcare Data:** Protected Health Information (PHI) if applicable.
    - **Intellectual Property:** Trade secrets, proprietary algorithms, source code snippets, business plans.
    - **Application Data:** Configuration settings, operational data, logs, and any other information managed by the application through the database.
- **Network Scope:** If the database server is compromised, it can become a pivot point for attackers to move laterally within the internal network, potentially affecting other servers, workstations, and network devices.

**Impact:**

The successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a cascade of negative consequences:

1. **Confidentiality Breach:**
    - Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data to malicious actors.
        
    - This data can be sold, used for identity theft, corporate espionage, or to launch targeted phishing attacks against individuals whose data was exposed.
    - Loss of competitive advantage if intellectual property is stolen.
2. **Integrity Compromise:**
    - Unauthorized creation, modification, or deletion of data.
        
    - This can result in corrupted business records, fraudulent financial transactions (e.g., altering account balances, redirecting payments), manipulation of application behavior, and dissemination of false information.
    - Damage to the trustworthiness of the organization's data.
3. **Availability Disruption:**
    - The database service, and consequently the Golang application and other dependent services, can be rendered unavailable.
        
    - This can occur through deletion of data or tables, dropping the entire database, resource exhaustion (e.g., running computationally expensive queries), or shutting down the database server if the unauthenticated connection has sufficient privileges.
    - Significant operational downtime and loss of productivity.
4. **Business Impact:**
    - **Financial Losses:** Direct costs associated with incident response, forensic investigation, data recovery, customer notifications, credit monitoring for affected individuals, and potential extortion payments (in ransomware scenarios). Indirect costs include lost revenue due to downtime and customer churn.
    - **Reputational Damage:** Erosion of customer trust and confidence in the organization's ability to protect their data. Negative media coverage and public perception can have long-lasting effects.
    - **Legal and Regulatory Penalties:** Non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI DSS) can result in substantial fines, lawsuits, and mandatory breach notifications.
    - **Operational Disruption:** Inability to conduct normal business operations if critical data or systems are compromised or unavailable.
5. **Technical Impact:**
    - **Full Database Server Compromise:** If high privileges are obtained, the attacker may gain complete control over the database server.
    - **Application Compromise:** The Golang application's security can be undermined if it relies on the integrity of data stored in the database for its own security decisions (e.g., user roles, permissions).
    - **Platform for Further Attacks:** The compromised database server can be used to launch attacks against other internal systems or to host malicious content.

For applications where the database is the central repository of value (e.g., a SaaS product whose primary offering is access to and manipulation of data), a breach due to missing authentication can be an existential threat, potentially leading to complete business failure. The ripple effects of such a breach can be extensive, impacting customers, partners, and the organization's overall viability.

## **14. Remediation Recommendation**

A robust remediation strategy for 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' in Golang applications involves a combination of secure coding practices, stringent configuration management for both the application and the database server, and ongoing security vigilance. The overarching goal is to ensure that every database connection is authenticated, authorized according to the principle of least privilege, and encrypted in transit.

**Key Remediation Techniques:**

| **Technique** | **Description** | **Golang Specifics / Tools** | **Database Specifics** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Enforce Strong Authentication** | Utilize strong, unique credentials (passwords, tokens, certificates) for all database accounts, especially those used by applications. | Ensure DSNs or `sql.Config` objects are fully populated with valid, non-empty credentials sourced securely. | Create database users with strong, unique passwords. Employ robust authentication methods like `scram-sha-256` (PostgreSQL) or `caching_sha2_password` (MySQL). Avoid empty passwords and `trust` authentication for network access. |
| **Secure Credential Management** | Store and manage database credentials securely, never hardcoding them in source code or committing them to version control. | Retrieve credentials at runtime from environment variables, or preferably, from dedicated secrets management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager) using their respective Go SDKs. | N/A (Primarily an application-side and operational concern for storing and providing credentials to the application). |
| **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** | Grant database user accounts used by the Golang application only the absolute minimum permissions necessary for their tasks. | The application code should operate with the privileges granted to its configured database user. | Use `GRANT` statements to assign specific permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT` on specific tables; `EXECUTE` on specific procedures) to the application's database user. Avoid granting broad privileges like `ALL PRIVILEGES` or superuser rights. |
| **Secure Database Server Configuration** | Harden the database server's global authentication settings and network exposure. | N/A (Database server administration task). | Critically review and configure files like `pg_hba.conf` (PostgreSQL) to disallow `trust` and mandate strong methods. For MySQL, audit user grants, ensure no users have empty passwords, and configure `bind-address` to limit network listeners. |
| **Use Encrypted Connections (TLS/SSL)** | Encrypt all data in transit between the Golang application and the database server to protect against eavesdropping. | Configure the Golang database driver to use TLS/SSL. For `lib/pq` (PostgreSQL), use `sslmode=require` or `verify-full`. For `go-sql-driver/mysql`, use `tls=true` or provide a `tls.Config`. | Configure the database server to support and require TLS/SSL connections, including provisioning valid server certificates and keys. |
| **Input Validation for DSN Components** | If DSN components are dynamically generated or sourced, validate them before use to prevent injection or misconfiguration. | Before constructing the DSN, check that variables for username, password, host, etc., are not empty and are well-formed. | N/A (Application-side validation). |
| **Regular Security Audits & Testing** | Proactively identify and remediate authentication weaknesses through continuous assessment. | Conduct regular code reviews focusing on database interaction points. Employ SAST tools to scan for insecure DSN construction or credential handling. Perform DAST and penetration testing on deployed applications. | Periodically audit database user accounts, their privileges, authentication methods, and network accessibility. Review server logs for suspicious connection attempts. |
| **Security Awareness & Training** | Educate developers, DBAs, and operations personnel on secure database access practices and credential management. | Training on secure DSN construction in Go, use of secrets management libraries, and PoLP. | Training on secure database configuration, user management, and network security. |
| **Defense in Depth** | Implement multiple layers of security controls. Do not rely on a single control (e.g., network firewall) to protect the database. | Implement robust error handling for database connection failures to avoid leaking sensitive information. | Combine strong authentication with network segmentation, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and regular patching. |

Remediation is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process. As applications evolve and infrastructure changes, security configurations must be continually reviewed and updated. The "easiest" fix, such as merely adding a password to the Golang application's DSN, might be insufficient if the underlying database server's authentication mechanism is still weak or misconfigured (e.g., PostgreSQL `trust` rule that ignores the password, or a MySQL configuration that bypasses password checks for certain users/hosts). True remediation requires that the database server *validates* the strong credentials provided by the Golang application using a secure authentication method.

## **15. Summary**

The 'Lack of Database Authentication Credentials' (db-auth-missing) in Golang applications represents a critical security vulnerability, classified under CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). It arises when Golang applications connect to database servers without supplying or enforcing proper authentication credentials, often due to misconfigured Data Source Names (DSNs), insecure default settings in development environments being promoted to production, or overly permissive database server configurations (e.g., `trust` authentication in PostgreSQL, MySQL users with empty passwords).

The consequences of this vulnerability are severe, potentially leading to complete unauthorized access to the database. This can result in the exfiltration of sensitive data, unauthorized modification or deletion of records, and denial of service, thereby compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data and the application itself. The impact extends to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.

Common mistakes contributing to this flaw include developers taking shortcuts by omitting credentials in development, mismanaging configuration files or environment variables that store these credentials, and a misunderstanding of how Golang's `database/sql` package and specific database drivers handle authentication. The simplicity of Go's database interaction mechanisms can sometimes mask the underlying complexities of secure authentication if not carefully managed.

Effective remediation requires a dual-pronged approach:

1. **Application-Side:** Golang applications must be coded to always use strong, unique credentials when connecting to databases. These credentials should be managed securely, ideally through secrets management systems or, at a minimum, secured environment variables, and never hardcoded.
2. **Database-Side:** Database servers must be hardened to require strong authentication for all connections, especially from application servers. This involves disabling insecure default accounts, configuring robust authentication methods (e.g., `scram-sha-256`), and applying the principle of least privilege to application database users.

Furthermore, all communication between the Golang application and the database should be encrypted using TLS/SSL. Regular security audits, static and dynamic analysis, penetration testing, and developer training are crucial components of a continuous strategy to prevent and mitigate this fundamental security risk. Addressing this vulnerability is not merely a technical fix but a foundational aspect of secure application development and data governance.
