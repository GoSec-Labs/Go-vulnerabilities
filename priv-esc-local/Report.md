## Vulnerability Title
Privilege Escalation in Local Services (short: priv-esc-local)

### Severity Rating
**HighðŸŸ  to CriticalðŸ”´**. A local privilege escalation allows an attacker who has already gained low-level access to a system to elevate their privileges to a higher level (e.g., administrator, root, or SYSTEM), essentially giving them full control over the compromised machine.

### Description
A privilege escalation vulnerability in a local service built with Go means that a less privileged user or process on the same machine can exploit a flaw in the Go service to gain higher privileges than intended. This can happen through various mechanisms, such as insecure file permissions, vulnerable inter-process communication (IPC), race conditions, unhandled errors, or misconfigurations that allow unauthorized execution of code with elevated permissions. Once exploited, an attacker can perform actions reserved for administrators, including installing malware, exfiltrating sensitive data, or disrupting system operations.

### Technical Description (for security pros)
A Go service, running with elevated privileges (e.g., as root/SYSTEM or a highly privileged service account), may contain a vulnerability that allows a local, unprivileged attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands with the service's privileges. Common technical causes in Go services include:

* **Insecure File Permissions**:
    * **Writable Configuration Files**: A Go service might read its configuration from a file (e.g., JSON, YAML, TOML) that is writable by low-privileged users. If the service reloads its configuration, an attacker could modify it to inject malicious commands or alter its behavior.
    * **Writable Executables/Libraries**: If the Go service's executable or any libraries it loads are writable by an unprivileged user, an attacker could replace them with malicious versions.
    * **Insecure Log Files**: If logs contain sensitive information or are processed by a privileged component, and writable by a low-privileged user, it could lead to data exposure or injection attacks.
* **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Vulnerabilities**:
    * **Unauthenticated/Unprivileged IPC Endpoints**: The Go service might expose an IPC mechanism (e.g., named pipes, Unix domain sockets, local TCP ports, gRPC, HTTP) that does not properly authenticate or authorize clients. A low-privileged process could then interact with this endpoint to trigger privileged actions.
    * **Insecure Deserialization**: If the IPC involves deserializing untrusted data from an unprivileged client, a deserialization vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the privileged service's context.
    * **Race Conditions/TOCTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use)**: If the service checks a resource (e.g., file existence or permissions) and then uses it later, an attacker could alter the resource between the check and the use, leading to unintended privileged operations.
* **Command Injection**: If the Go service constructs system commands or executes external binaries based on unvalidated or insufficiently sanitized input from a low-privileged source, an attacker could inject malicious commands that run with the service's privileges.
* **Insecure Environment Variables**: A privileged service might rely on environment variables that can be manipulated by a low-privileged user, leading to code execution or path manipulation vulnerabilities.
* **DLL/Shared Library Hijacking (Windows/Linux)**: If the service loads dynamic link libraries (`.dll` on Windows, `.so` on Linux) from directories that are writable by a low-privileged user, an attacker could place a malicious library that gets loaded instead of the legitimate one.
* **Unsafe handling of user-controlled paths**: The service might operate on file paths provided by unprivileged users without proper validation, leading to directory traversal attacks that modify or create files in privileged locations.

### Common Mistakes That Cause This
* **Running Services with Excessive Privileges**: Deploying a Go service as root/SYSTEM when it only needs a subset of privileges. Adhering to the principle of least privilege is crucial.
* **Inadequate Input Validation and Sanitization**: Failing to properly validate and sanitize all input received from local users or less privileged processes, especially when inputs are used to construct file paths, commands, or arguments for privileged operations.
* **Incorrect File/Directory Permissions**: Setting overly permissive permissions (e.g., world-writable) on configuration files, executables, logs, or temporary directories used by the privileged service.
* **Lack of Authentication/Authorization for Local IPC**: Not implementing proper authentication and authorization checks on local IPC mechanisms, assuming that local access implies trustworthiness.
* **Ignoring Race Conditions**: Not considering Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerabilities when performing file operations or other stateful actions based on external input.
* **Hardcoding Sensitive Information**: Embedding credentials or sensitive configuration directly in the Go application code, which could be exposed if the binary is inspected.
* **Poor Error Handling**: Not robustly handling errors, which might expose internal state or lead to unexpected behavior that can be exploited.
* **Using `os/exec` unsafely**: Directly concatenating user input into commands executed via `os/exec` functions without using proper argument passing.

### Exploitation Goals
* **Gain Root/SYSTEM Privileges**: The ultimate goal is to obtain the highest level of control over the host system.
* **Install Malware/Backdoors**: Establish persistent access or deploy other malicious payloads (e.g., ransomware, cryptominers).
* **Access Sensitive Data**: Read, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive files, databases, or credentials stored on the host.
* **Disrupt System Operations**: Cause denial of service, tamper with system configurations, or disable security software.
* **Lateral Movement**: Use the compromised host as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.

### Affected Components or Files
* The Go executable of the vulnerable local service.
* Configuration files read by the privileged Go service.
* Log files generated by the privileged Go service.
* Any IPC communication channels (e.g., named pipes, Unix domain sockets, local TCP ports) used by the Go service.
* Temporary directories used by the Go service.
* Libraries or plugins loaded by the Go service.

### Vulnerable Code Snippet
(Illustrative example for insecure file permissions leading to potential configuration modification)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
	"os/exec"
)

const configFilePath = "/etc/mygoservice/config.json" // Path to sensitive config file
const privilegedCommand = "/usr/bin/super_tool"      // A command that requires high privileges

func main() {
	// Simulate running as a privileged service
	if os.Getuid() != 0 {
		fmt.Println("This service should be run as root to demonstrate the vulnerability.")
		fmt.Println("Please run with 'sudo ./mygoservice'")
		return
	}

	// --- VULNERABILITY: Insecure file permissions on configuration file ---
	// In a real scenario, this file might have been created with insecure permissions
	// during installation or due to incorrect `os.Chmod` usage.
	// For demonstration, let's create a dummy config with insecure permissions.
	err := ioutil.WriteFile(configFilePath, []byte(`{"enable_debug": false, "command_arg": "default"}`), 0666) // 0666 = writable by anyone
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error creating config file: %v\n", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("Config file created at %s with insecure permissions (0666).\n", configFilePath)

	// Simulate service reading and acting on config
	fmt.Println("Service is now reading and acting on its configuration...")
	config, err := readConfig(configFilePath)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error reading config: %v\n", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("Current config: %+v\n", config)

	// Simulate a privileged operation based on config
	if config["enable_debug"].(bool) {
		fmt.Println("Debug mode enabled. Executing privileged debug command...")
		cmd := exec.Command(privilegedCommand, config["command_arg"].(string))
		cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
		cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
		if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error executing privileged command: %v\n", err)
		}
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Debug mode disabled. Normal operation.")
	}

	fmt.Println("Service finished its operation.")
	// In a real service, this would be a long-running process,
	// potentially re-reading config or accepting IPC commands.
}

func readConfig(path string) (map[string]interface{}, error) {
	data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(path)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to read config file: %w", err)
	}
	var config map[string]interface{}
	// In a real app, use json.Unmarshal, or other config parser
	// For simplicity, let's parse a very basic key-value from string
	config = make(map[string]interface{})
	if string(data) == `{"enable_debug": false, "command_arg": "default"}` {
		config["enable_debug"] = false
		config["command_arg"] = "default"
	} else if string(data) == `{"enable_debug": true, "command_arg": "malicious_payload; /bin/sh -c 'echo ROOTED > /root/pwned.txt'"}` {
		config["enable_debug"] = true
		config["command_arg"] = "malicious_payload; /bin/sh -c 'echo ROOTED > /root/pwned.txt'"
	} else {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("unrecognized config format")
	}
	return config, nil
}
```

### Detection Steps
1.  **Permission Audits**: Manually or automatically scan for insecure file permissions (e.g., world-writable, owned by a non-privileged user but writable by others) on:
    * The Go service executable itself.
    * Configuration files, log files, or temporary directories used by the service.
    * Directories in the service's `PATH` that are writable by low-privileged users.
2.  **Code Review**:
    * Examine Go code for `os/exec` calls, looking for unvalidated user input being used to construct commands.
    * Review IPC mechanisms (e.g., `net`, `os/signal`, `encoding/json` for deserialization) for proper authentication, authorization, and input validation.
    * Look for potential race conditions when handling files or external resources.
    * Identify hardcoded credentials or API keys.
3.  **Process Monitoring**: Monitor processes for unusual child processes being spawned by the privileged Go service, or unusual network connections.
4.  **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)**: Use SAST tools that understand Go to identify potential vulnerabilities related to input validation, command injection, and insecure configuration.
5.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Penetration Testing)**: Actively try to exploit the service by sending malformed or malicious inputs through its exposed interfaces (local sockets, APIs, command-line arguments) from a low-privileged user account.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)
(Assuming the Go service from the "Vulnerable Code Snippet" is running as root)

1.  **Compile the vulnerable Go service:**
    ```bash
    go build -o mygoservice main.go
    ```
2.  **Run the service (as root/sudo):**
    ```bash
    sudo ./mygoservice
    ```
    (Output will show the config file `/etc/mygoservice/config.json` created with 0666 permissions.)

3.  **As a low-privileged user (in a separate terminal):**
    * Verify file permissions:
        ```bash
        ls -l /etc/mygoservice/config.json
        # Expected output: -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root ... /etc/mygoservice/config.json
        ```
    * Modify the configuration file to enable debug mode and inject a command:
        ```bash
        echo '{"enable_debug": true, "command_arg": "malicious_payload; /bin/sh -c \"echo ROOTED > /root/pwned.txt\""}' > /etc/mygoservice/config.json
        ```
        (In a real-world scenario, the service would need to re-read its config, e.g., on a signal or periodic refresh. For this simple PoC, the service would need to be restarted or triggered to reload.)

    * **Trigger the service to reload/re-evaluate config (manual step for PoC):**
        * If the service has a graceful reload mechanism (e.g., `kill -HUP <pid_of_mygoservice>`), use it.
        * Otherwise, restart the service (this might require `sudo` again, but the vulnerability demonstrates that the _file modification_ was possible by a low-privileged user).

    * **Verify escalation:**
        ```bash
        cat /root/pwned.txt
        # Expected output: ROOTED
        ```
        This demonstrates that a low-privileged user was able to write to a root-owned directory (`/root/`) by injecting a command that was executed by the privileged Go service.

### Fix & Patch Guidance
1.  **Principle of Least Privilege**:
    * **Run as non-root**: Configure the Go service to run with the minimum necessary privileges. If it absolutely needs access to privileged resources, consider breaking it down into smaller, less privileged components that communicate with a single, highly-secured, and strictly audited privileged component.
    * **Drop privileges**: If the service starts as root (e.g., to bind to a low port), it should immediately drop privileges to a non-root user after performing the necessary privileged operation. Use libraries like `syscall` or platform-specific methods to change user/group IDs.
2.  **Secure File Permissions**:
    * Ensure all configuration files, executables, and sensitive directories used by the service have strict permissions (e.g., read-only by the service owner, no write access for other users).
    * When creating files, use `os.Chmod` with appropriate permissions (e.g., `0600` for private config, `0700` for executables).
3.  **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization**:
    * **Never trust user input**: All input received from local users or less privileged processes must be strictly validated against an allowlist of expected formats and values.
    * When executing external commands via `os/exec`, **always use the slice form** `exec.Command("command", "arg1", "arg2")` rather than concatenating input into a single string. This prevents command injection.
    * When interacting with file paths from user input, use `filepath.Clean` and ensure paths are within expected boundaries (e.g., disallow `..` for directory traversal).
4.  **Secure IPC**:
    * Implement strong authentication and authorization for all local IPC mechanisms. Use OS-level access controls (e.g., Unix socket permissions, Windows ACLs for named pipes) in addition to application-level checks.
    * Validate and sanitize all data received via IPC before processing. Avoid insecure deserialization of untrusted data.
5.  **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to prevent unexpected states or information disclosure.
6.  **Dependency Management**: Keep all Go modules and system libraries up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
7.  **Containerization**: If deploying in containers, follow container security best practices (non-privileged containers, non-root users, strict security contexts).

### Scope and Impact
* **Scope**: Any Go application or service running on a local machine (server, workstation, embedded device) with elevated privileges, and interacting with or exposed to lower-privileged users or processes.
* **Impact**:
    * **Complete System Compromise**: The most severe impact, leading to full control over the host system.
    * **Data Breach/Integrity Loss**: Unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data.
    * **System Misconfiguration/Disruption**: Malicious changes to the operating system or installed software.
    * **Persistence**: Installation of backdoors or other mechanisms for continued access.
    * **Lateral Movement**: Compromise of other systems reachable from the affected host.

### Remediation Recommendation
Conduct a thorough security audit of all Go local services, focusing on their deployed permissions, input handling, IPC mechanisms, and file access. Implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring services run with only the absolute minimum required permissions. Prioritize robust input validation and safe command execution. Enforce strict file and directory permissions for all service-related assets. Integrate security testing (SAST, DAST, penetration testing) into the development and deployment lifecycle to proactively identify and remediate these critical vulnerabilities.

### Summary
Privilege escalation in local Go services represents a critical security flaw where a low-privileged attacker can gain elevated control over a system. This typically stems from misconfigurations such as overly permissive file permissions, insecure inter-process communication, or vulnerable handling of user input leading to command injection. Remediation involves strictly adhering to the principle of least privilege by running services with minimal permissions, implementing rigorous input validation, securing IPC channels, and enforcing proper file system permissions. Proactive security testing is paramount to detect and prevent such vulnerabilities.
