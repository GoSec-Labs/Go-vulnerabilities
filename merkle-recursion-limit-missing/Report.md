# Golang Merkle Tree Vulnerability: Unbounded Recursion (merkle-recursion-limit-missing) Report

## Severity Rating

The "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability, designated as `merkle-recursion-limit-missing`, represents a significant threat to the availability of Golang applications. An assessment using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 indicates a **HighðŸŸ ** severity rating.

The CVSS v3.1 Base Score is calculated as **7.5 (HighðŸŸ )**, with the following vector string: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`. This vector provides a standardized, quantifiable assessment of the vulnerability's characteristics and potential impact, enabling security professionals to prioritize remediation efforts effectively.

The breakdown of the CVSS metrics is as follows:

| CVSS Metric | Value | Description and Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Attack Vector (AV)** | Network (N) | The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network. An attacker does not require physical access to the system to initiate an attack. This is achieved by sending specially crafted Merkle proof data or input that triggers the unbounded recursion. |

The pattern of resource exhaustion, categorized under CWE-770 ("Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"), is a recurring theme in Golang applications. Several documented Golang-specific Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2022-2879 and CVE-2023-39322, are explicitly linked to uncontrolled resource consumption and unbounded memory growth.3 This indicates a systemic risk within Golang when processing untrusted, user-controlled input that can dictate resource-intensive operations, particularly recursive ones, if proper limits are not enforced. A similar unbounded recursion leading to a server crash and high availability impact has also been observed in TensorFlow, as documented in CVE-2025-0649.2 This broader context suggests that the "no limit on Merkle recursion" is a specific manifestation of this general class of vulnerability. Developers must therefore be acutely aware of CWE-770 not only in cryptographic data structures but across all components that process external input and perform resource-intensive operations, especially those involving recursion or iterative processing of large or complex data.

The selected CVSS score of 7.5 (High) with Availability: High aligns consistently with other documented Go vulnerabilities that lead to resource exhaustion and DoS. For example, the aforementioned CVE-2022-2879 and CVE-2023-39322, both related to "uncontrolled resource consumption" and "unbounded memory growth" in Golang, are also rated 7.5 (High) with Availability: High.3 This consistency in assessment reinforces the chosen severity and vector for the Merkle recursion vulnerability, indicating a standard industry evaluation for this type of impact. Such alignment allows for more effective prioritization of remediation efforts by security teams, as the impact is quantifiable and comparable to other known high-severity DoS issues.

## Description

A Merkle tree, often referred to as a hash tree, is a fundamental data structure widely employed for the efficient verification of the integrity and consistency of large datasets.7 It is structured as an inverted binary tree, with leaf nodes at the bottom and the root at the top. Each leaf node typically contains the cryptographic hash of an individual data block, such as a transaction in a blockchain. Non-leaf nodes, conversely, are formed by recursively combining the hashes of their two child nodes. This iterative hashing process culminates in a single hash at the apex of the tree, known as the Merkle root, which cryptographically commits to the entire underlying dataset. The primary advantage of this structure is its ability to enable efficient data verification (via Merkle proofs) without necessitating the download or processing of the entire dataset.

The construction and verification of Merkle trees are inherently recursive processes. Each level of the tree is built by repeatedly hashing pairs of child nodes until the singular root is formed. Similarly, the verification of a Merkle proof involves iteratively hashing the provided leaf and intermediate nodes to reconstruct the expected root hash. This recursive design is precisely what imparts Merkle trees with their efficiency and cryptographic strength. However, this inherent reliance on recursion means that any failure to properly bound or manage recursive calls in the implementation directly translates into a fundamental structural vulnerability. The very feature that makes Merkle trees powerfulâ€”recursive hashingâ€”becomes the attack vector if not handled with meticulous care.

The "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability arises when a Merkle tree implementation in Golang fails to enforce a maximum depth for its recursive operations during either tree construction or proof verification. Without such a limit, an attacker can craft a malicious input, such as a Merkle proof or a set of transactions designed to create an extremely deep or unbalanced tree, that causes the recursive function calls to exceed the program's allocated stack limit or consume excessive memory. This scenario leads to a Denial of Service (DoS), effectively rendering the application or service unavailable. This type of attack is a classic example of resource exhaustion.

While a "stack overflow" is the most immediate and commonly understood consequence of unbounded recursion , resource exhaustion can manifest in other critical ways. Research indicates that such vulnerabilities can also lead to excessive memory consumption  and even significant consumption of CPU time.3 A deeply structured Merkle tree, even if it does not immediately trigger a stack overflow, can cause a substantial increase in computationally intensive hashing operations and memory usage for storing intermediate nodes or proof elements. This broader impact means that the vulnerability is not solely about crashing the program; it also encompasses degrading service performance and increasing operational costs for the victim, potentially leading to a "soft" DoS before a hard crash.

## Technical Description (for security pros)

The exploitation of "No limit on Merkle recursion" leverages the absence of explicit recursion depth limits within Merkle tree processing functions. When an application processes a Merkle proof or constructs a tree from a large, maliciously crafted dataset, each recursive call adds a new stack frame to the call stack.

This leads to several potential attack vectors:

- **Stack Overflow**: If the input data is designed to create an excessively deep logical treeâ€”for instance, an extremely long Merkle proof for a single "leaf" that is, in fact, an intermediate node, or a tree with a large number of elements forcing a deep recursion pathâ€”the number of recursive calls can quickly exceed the default stack size allocated for the Go routine. This inevitably results in a stack overflow, causing the program to panic and crash.
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Beyond the stack, each node within a Merkle tree and every element in a Merkle proof necessitate memory allocation. An attacker can craft an input that, even if it does not immediately cause a stack overflow, leads to an exponential surge in memory consumption for storing hashes and tree nodes during the recursive processing. This can deplete available RAM, leading to system instability, severe slowdowns, or outright crashes.
- **CPU Exhaustion**: The hashing operations performed at each step of Merkle tree construction or verification are computationally intensive. An extremely deep or wide tree, or a proof requiring numerous hashing steps, can consume significant CPU cycles. This results in severe performance degradation and a Denial of Service, as the system becomes unable to process legitimate requests efficiently.

The length of a Merkle proof is logarithmically proportional to the number of leaves in a balanced tree, typically expressed as log2(N).21 However, an attacker can manipulate the input structure to create an unbalanced tree or a proof that forces a disproportionately deep recursion path, even for a relatively small number of "logical" leaves. This is particularly relevant in systems where the proof structure is not strictly validated against an expected tree shape. In Golang, goroutines possess dynamically sized stacks. While Go's runtime can grow these stacks as needed, an unbounded recursive loop will eventually exhaust the available memory or hit an internal runtime limit, culminating in a runtime panic and program termination.

It is important to distinguish between cryptographic attacks on hash functions, such as second preimage or collision attacks , and implementation flaws. The "no limit on recursion" is primarily an *implementation* vulnerability, exploiting the resource handling of the Golang runtime rather than a weakness in the underlying cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA256). However, certain Merkle tree vulnerabilities, such as the second preimage attack , can be exacerbated by implementation choices that allow intermediate nodes to masquerade as leaves. This could indirectly lead to unexpected recursive paths or increased resource consumption if the input is not properly canonicalized. Security professionals must therefore differentiate between cryptographic design flaws and implementation-specific resource vulnerabilities. While strong hash functions are crucial for data integrity, they do not inherently protect against resource exhaustion attacks stemming from poor recursion management.

Many Merkle tree implementations, especially in simpler libraries or custom code, implicitly assume that the input dataâ€”such as the number of transactions or the structure of a Merkle proofâ€”will conform to a "reasonable" or "expected" tree depth. This implicit trust, rather than explicit validation and limiting, is a fundamental cause of this vulnerability. Historical incidents, such as those affecting Bitcoin Core (CVE-2012-2459, re-introduced in 0.13.0, fixed in 0.14.0, and CVE-2017-12842) 11, and the documented "no commitment to block merkle tree depth" 25, highlight this recurring oversight in widely adopted systems. Any system processing Merkle proofs or constructing Merkle trees from untrusted sources must implement strict input validation and explicit depth limits, treating all external input as potentially malicious. This is a critical design principle for building robust and resilient systems.

## Common Mistakes That Cause This

The presence of the "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability typically stems from a combination of programming errors and design oversights in the implementation of Merkle tree operations.

One of the most direct causes is the **lack of explicit depth limits**. Developers often fail to incorporate a maximum recursion depth parameter or a check within recursive functions responsible for building or verifying Merkle trees. This omission frequently arises from an assumption that inputs will always be "well-behaved" or that the underlying data structure will inherently limit the recursion depth, which is often not the case with malicious inputs.

**Insufficient input validation** is another critical contributor. If the application does not adequately validate the size, structure, or complexity of input dataâ€”such as the number of transactions or the length of a Merkle proofâ€”before initiating recursive processing, an attacker can submit an arbitrarily large or deeply nested input. This allows the malicious input to directly dictate the depth of recursion, leading to resource exhaustion.

In distributed systems, **trusting client-provided proof lengths or structures** without server-side validation is a significant vulnerability. For instance, a lightweight client might provide a Merkle proof to a full node or smart contract. If the server-side logic implicitly accepts the length or structure of this proof without rigorous validation, it creates an avenue for exploitation.11 This exemplifies an "implicit contract" fallacy in software development, where inputs are assumed to adhere to an "honest" or "expected" format rather than being designed with adversarial inputs in mind. The observation that many implementations incorrectly assume "if you pass a series of inputs into a Merkle Tree and get a root hash value out, there are no other inputs that could lead to that hash value" 20 underscores this implicit trust.

**Improper handling of unbalanced trees** can also contribute to this vulnerability. While Merkle trees are often conceptualized as perfectly balanced binary trees, real-world implementations must account for unbalanced structures (e.g., when the number of leaves is not a power of two, often requiring duplication of the last element). If the logic for handling these unbalanced trees introduces unexpected recursive paths or inefficiencies that are not properly bounded, it can exacerbate the recursion depth issue.

An **over-reliance on language defaults** is another common pitfall. Developers might assume that Go's runtime will automatically manage excessive recursion without explicit intervention. While Go's goroutines have dynamically sized stacks, they are not infinite, and an unbounded recursive loop will eventually exhaust the available memory or hit an internal limit, leading to a crash.

Finally, **ignoring historical precedents** contributes to the re-introduction of similar flaws. Similar vulnerabilities related to Merkle tree depth or size have been reported and subsequently fixed in major projects like Bitcoin Core (CVE-2012-2459, CVE-2017-12842, CVE-2016-10724, CVE-2016-10725). Failing to learn from these past incidents and apply the lessons to new implementations can lead to the recurrence of comparable vulnerabilities.

While the "second preimage attack"  is a distinct cryptographic attack, it shares a common underlying theme with "recursion limit missing" in that both exploit the *structure* of the Merkle tree and the assumptions made during its processing. The second preimage attack specifically involves making an intermediate node masquerade as a leaf.24 If an implementation permits this, it could potentially lead to unexpected recursive paths or larger perceived tree depths, even if the primary goal is not stack overflow. The defense against second preimage attacks (e.g., prepending bytes, double hashing leaves)  also relies on canonicalizing input, which is a general best practice for preventing structural abuses. Robust Merkle tree implementations should therefore not only enforce recursion limits but also implement canonicalization techniques to prevent structural attacks that could indirectly impact resource consumption or lead to other vulnerabilities.

## Exploitation Goals

The primary objective of exploiting a "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability is to disrupt the availability and performance of the target system, typically achieving a Denial of Service (DoS).

The most direct and common exploitation goal is a **Denial of Service (DoS)**. By triggering unbounded recursion, an attacker aims to crash the application, rendering it completely unavailable to legitimate users. This can have severe consequences for any service relying on the affected application.

Beyond a complete crash, attackers also aim for **resource exhaustion**:

- **CPU Exhaustion**: The attacker forces the system to perform an excessive number of computationally intensive hashing operations. This consumes all available CPU cycles, leading to severe slowdowns or freezing of the application, making it unresponsive.
- **Memory Exhaustion**: The malicious input causes the application to consume all available RAM, leading to memory leaks, system instability, or out-of-memory (OOM) errors. This includes both stack memory, which is consumed by recursive function calls, and heap memory, used for storing large tree structures or proof elements.
- **Network Bandwidth Exhaustion (Indirect)**: While not a direct goal of this specific vulnerability, a system that is constantly crashing and restarting due to a DoS attack can generate increased network traffic from connection attempts and retries. This indirectly impacts network resources, potentially affecting other services or the overall network infrastructure.

Even if a system does not outright crash, a successful attack can lead to severe **performance degradation**. This manifests as slow response times, frequent timeouts, and a generally poor user experience, effectively making the service unusable for its intended purpose. Repeated crashes or persistent resource exhaustion can also lead to an **unstable system state**, potentially requiring manual intervention, prolonged downtime, or even data corruption if operations are interrupted mid-process.

In specific contexts, such as blockchain networks, a related vulnerability known as an "invalidity caching attack" (CVE-2012-2459) has been observed.11 This attack involved crafting a block with an identical Merkle root but invalid transactions. While not directly a recursion limit issue, it illustrates how Merkle tree manipulation can lead to a Denial of Service by causing nodes to cache invalid states, preventing them from processing legitimate blocks. This highlights the broader potential for Merkle tree vulnerabilities to cause complex operational disruptions.

The impact of Denial of Service extends beyond immediate technical downtime. It can lead to significant **reputational damage** for the affected project or organization, eroding user trust. Furthermore, it can result in **financial losses** due to service disruption, lost revenue, and increased operational costs associated with incident response and recovery efforts. The observation that resource exhaustion can manifest as severe performance degradation or system instability, even without an outright crash, means that monitoring and detection strategies should not only look for crashes but also for unusual spikes in CPU, memory, and network usage. These indicators can signal an ongoing, less overt DoS attack. Organizations must consider the business continuity and reputational risks associated with such vulnerabilities, not just the technical fix, which elevates the priority of remediation.

## Affected Components or Files

The "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability can manifest in various components and types of files within a Golang application that interacts with Merkle trees. Understanding these susceptible areas is crucial for comprehensive security assessments.

Primarily, **Merkle Tree Implementation Libraries** are at risk. Any custom-developed or third-party Golang libraries used for the construction, updating, or verification of Merkle trees, such as `github.com/cbergoon/merkletree` 21 or similar implementations, are potential points of failure. These libraries often contain the core recursive logic.

Closely related are the **Merkle Proof Verification Logic** functions. These are typically responsible for taking a Merkle root, a specific leaf, and a proof, then verifying the leaf's inclusion in the tree. Such functions inherently involve recursive hashing operations to traverse the tree structure. If these recursive calls are not bounded, they become vulnerable.

**Data Ingestion and Processing Modules** are also critical points. Components that receive and process untrusted input dataâ€”for example, transaction lists in a blockchain, file chunks in a distributed storage system, or whitelisted addresses for an airdropâ€”and subsequently use this data to build a Merkle tree, are susceptible. The vulnerability does not necessarily reside in the Merkle tree *library* itself, but rather in the *integration* of that library with input processing logic. If the data ingestion module fails to validate the input, it passes potentially malicious data to the Merkle tree functions, which then, if lacking internal limits, trigger the recursion issue. This highlights a "chain of trust" where a weakness in an upstream component (input validation) can propagate to a downstream component (Merkle tree processing).

**Network Handlers and APIs** are direct exposure points. Any API endpoints or network services that accept Merkle proofs or raw data intended for processing into a Merkle tree are vulnerable. This includes blockchain nodes receiving new blocks or a service verifying data integrity from a client. Go's `net/http` package, if used for such endpoints, could be involved in receiving the malicious input.3

Furthermore, **Serialization and Deserialization Logic** can exacerbate the problem. Code that converts raw bytes into structured data, which then feeds into Merkle tree operations, can be exploited. If this logic allows for deeply nested or excessively long structures to be formed from malicious inputs, it can amplify the recursion issue when the data is passed to the Merkle tree functions.

Finally, while not directly vulnerable themselves, **Cryptographic Hashing Functions** (e.g., `crypto/sha256` 7, `keccak256` ) are heavily utilized in Merkle tree operations. Excessive calls to these functions due to unbounded recursion contribute significantly to CPU exhaustion, even if the functions themselves are cryptographically sound.

The challenge of third-party libraries versus custom implementations is noteworthy. While some robust libraries might exist (e.g., OpenZeppelin for Solidity Merkle proofs 9), many Go projects might opt for custom Merkle tree implementations or simpler, less-vetted libraries. These custom or less-audited implementations are more prone to missing crucial security controls like recursion limits, as they might prioritize simplicity or specific use cases over comprehensive security hardening. Therefore, a holistic security review is necessary, extending beyond just the Merkle tree code to examine how data flows into and is processed by these components. Input validation should be performed as early as possible in the data processing pipeline. Organizations should prefer well-audited, mature cryptographic libraries, and if custom implementations are necessary, they must undergo rigorous security reviews, including explicit checks for recursion depth limits and resource handling.

## Vulnerable Code Snippet

The following Golang code snippet illustrates a common implementation of a recursive Merkle tree construction function that is vulnerable to unbounded recursion. This example demonstrates how the absence of an explicit depth limit can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) through a stack overflow.

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/sha256"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

// MerkleNode represents a node in the Merkle tree
type MerkleNode struct {
	Hash  string
	Left  *MerkleNode
	Right *MerkleNode
}

// calculateHash computes SHA-256 hash of a given data string
func calculateHash(data string) string {
	hash := sha256.Sum256(byte(data))
	return fmt.Sprintf("%x", hash)
}

// buildMerkleTree recursively constructs a Merkle tree from a slice of data
// THIS FUNCTION IS VULNERABLE TO UNBOUNDED RECURSION
func buildMerkleTree(datastring) *MerkleNode {
	// Base case: if only one element, create a leaf node
	if len(data) == 1 {
		return &MerkleNode{Hash: calculateHash(data), Left: nil, Right: nil}
	}

	// Recursive case: split data, build left and right subtrees, then combine
	mid := len(data) / 2
	left := buildMerkleTree(data[:mid])   // Recursive call 1
	right := buildMerkleTree(data[mid:]) // Recursive call 2

	// Combine hashes of children to form parent hash
	combinedHash := calculateHash(left.Hash + right.Hash)
	return &MerkleNode{Hash: combinedHash, Left: left, Right: right}
}

// printTree (for visualization, not directly vulnerable to recursion limit itself)
func printTree(node *MerkleNode, indent string) {
	if node!= nil {
		fmt.Printf("%sHash: %s\n", indent, node.Hash)
		if node.Left!= nil {
			printTree(node.Left, indent+"  ")
		}
		if node.Right!= nil {
			printTree(node.Right, indent+"  ")
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	// Example of normal usage
	fmt.Println("--- Normal Merkle Tree (Depth 2) ---")
	normalData :=string{"txA", "txB", "txC", "txD"}
	normalRoot := buildMerkleTree(normalData)
	printTree(normalRoot, "")
	fmt.Printf("Normal Root Hash: %s\n\n", normalRoot.Hash)

	// --- VULNERABILITY DEMONSTRATION ---
	// An attacker can provide an extremely large input array to trigger deep recursion.
	// This will cause a stack overflow.
	// The depth of recursion is log2(len(data)). For a large N, this can be significant.
	// E.g., for 2^20 elements, depth is 20. For 2^25 elements, depth is 25.
	// Go's default stack size for a goroutine is typically 2KB and grows dynamically,
	// but an unbounded recursion will eventually exhaust it.
	// The stack frames for each call to buildMerkleTree add up.

	// WARNING: Running this with a very large 'depth' will likely crash your program.

	// Larger values will likely lead to stack overflow.

	if len(os.Args) > 1 {
		depthStr = os.Args
	}
	
	depth, err := strconv.Atoi(depthStr)
	if err!= nil |
| depth <= 0 {
		log.Fatalf("Invalid depth argument. Please provide a positive integer. Err: %v", err)
	}

	numElements := 1 << depth // Calculate 2^depth elements
	fmt.Printf("--- Attempting to build Merkle Tree with 2^%d = %d elements (potentially vulnerable) ---\n", depth, numElements)

	attackerData := make(string, numElements)
	for i := 0; i < numElements; i++ {
		attackerData[i] = fmt.Sprintf("malicious_data_%d", i)
	}

	// This call will likely cause a stack overflow for large 'depth' values
	fmt.Println("Building malicious Merkle tree...")
	maliciousRoot := buildMerkleTree(attackerData)
	fmt.Printf("Malicious Root Hash: %s\n", maliciousRoot.Hash) // This line may not be reached
}
```

The `buildMerkleTree` function in this snippet is recursive, calling itself twice to construct the `left` and `right` subtrees.7 Crucially, there is no explicit `maxDepth` parameter or check implemented within `buildMerkleTree`. The recursion depth is solely determined by the length of the input `data` slice. For a perfectly balanced tree, this depth is `log2(len(data))`. An attacker can provide an arbitrarily large `data` slice, causing the recursion depth to grow proportionally. When this depth exceeds the Go routine's stack limit, a stack overflow occurs, leading to a program crash and a Denial of Service. The `main` function demonstrates how to trigger this by creating a large `attackerData` slice. For `depth` values around 22-25 (depending on the system and Go version), this will likely cause a stack overflow.

The simplicity of this vulnerable code is striking. It represents a standard recursive binary tree construction algorithm.7 The absence of a single line of codeâ€”a depth checkâ€”transforms what is otherwise a common and efficient pattern into a critical DoS vulnerability. This highlights that even seemingly innocuous omissions can have severe security implications, especially in languages like Go where explicit bounds are often preferred over implicit runtime protections for such cases. Security reviews should therefore pay close attention to recursive functions, regardless of their apparent simplicity, and explicitly verify the presence and correctness of termination conditions and resource limits.

The logarithmic nature of Merkle tree depth, while efficient for legitimate use, paradoxically makes it an effective enabler for attacks. The depth of a balanced Merkle tree grows logarithmically with the number of leaves.21 This means an attacker only needs to increase the input size polynomially (e.g., 2^N elements) to achieve a linear increase in recursion depth (N). This makes it computationally feasible for an attacker to craft inputs that lead to very deep recursion paths without requiring an astronomically large input size. For example, a depth of 25 requires 2^25 (approximately 33 million) elements, which is a large but manageable input for an attacker to generate. The efficiency of Merkle trees for legitimate use thus also makes them efficient targets for resource exhaustion if depth limits are absent. The attacker does not need to generate an "infinite" input, only one that is large enough to exceed typical system limits.

## Detection Steps

Identifying the "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability requires a multi-faceted approach, combining meticulous manual inspection with automated static and dynamic analysis techniques.

**Code Review and Manual Inspection** are fundamental. Security professionals should meticulously examine all functions responsible for Merkle tree construction (e.g., `buildMerkleTree` in the example) and Merkle proof verification. The review should specifically look for recursive function calls, where a function calls itself directly or indirectly (e.g., `funcA` calling `funcB` which then calls `funcA`).14 It is crucial to verify that these recursive functions incorporate an explicit `depth` parameter or a `RecursionContext`  that is checked against a `maxDepth` limit as a base case. Furthermore, it must be ensured that robust input validation precedes any recursive processing to limit the maximum possible depth or size of the incoming data, preventing malicious inputs from reaching the recursive logic.

**Static Analysis Tools** can assist, though with certain limitations. Standard Go tooling like `go vet` is generally not designed to detect unbounded recursion. The Go team's philosophy suggests that such issues are often "obvious" or pose a challenge to detect generally (due to the Halting Problem), and attempts to do so could lead to an excessive number of false positives. This is a fundamental limitation of static analysis for this class of vulnerability, meaning developers cannot rely solely on automated static analysis for unbounded recursion. Manual code review and robust dynamic testing become even more critical. More comprehensive static analysis tools, such as `StaticCheck` or `golangci-lint` (which bundles various linters including `StaticCheck` and `govet`) , should be utilized. While direct checks for "unbounded recursion" remain challenging, these tools might detect related issues like excessive cyclomatic complexity 29 or potential resource allocation issues that could indirectly point to the problem. For critical applications, consider building custom static analysis tools using Go's `go/analysis` API  to specifically identify recursive functions that lack explicit depth parameters or checks, tailored to the project's unique Merkle tree implementation.

**Dynamic Analysis and Profiling** are essential for uncovering runtime behavior that static analysis cannot predict.

- **Load Testing and Fuzzing**: Subject the application to rigorous load tests with varying sizes and depths of Merkle tree inputs and proofs. Employ fuzzing tools to generate malformed or excessively large inputs, specifically designed to trigger edge cases and potential resource exhaustion scenarios.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system resources, including CPU, memory, and stack usage, during testing. Utilize Go's built-in `pprof` or external tools like Prometheus and Grafana.31 Look for sudden, anomalous spikes in memory consumption, prolonged high CPU utilization, or unexpected application crashes that indicate resource exhaustion.
- **Error Tracking and Logging**: Implement robust error tracking solutions (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) and structured logging.31 These systems should be configured to capture panics or unrecoverable errors, which can be direct indicators of stack overflows or out-of-memory conditions. This allows for real-time feedback on resource consumption, which is the ultimate manifestation of this vulnerability.

Given the inherent limitations of static analysis for detecting all instances of unbounded recursion, a multi-layered detection strategy is indispensable. Manual code review provides the deep contextual understanding that automated tools often lack. Dynamic analysis and profiling effectively capture runtime behavior that static analysis cannot predict. The various monitoring tools provide real-time feedback on resource consumption, which is the ultimate manifestation of this vulnerability. A comprehensive security posture therefore requires a defense-in-depth approach, combining preventative measures (secure coding), detection (static and dynamic analysis), and continuous monitoring to effectively identify and respond to attacks.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

A Proof of Concept (PoC) for the "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability aims to demonstrate how an attacker can trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) by causing a stack overflow or excessive memory consumption in a vulnerable Golang application.

**Objective**: The primary objective is to render the target application unavailable by forcing its Merkle tree processing functions to exceed their resource limits.

**Prerequisites**:

- A Golang application that implements Merkle tree construction or proof verification using recursive functions.
- The critical recursive function(s) within this application must lack an explicit `maxDepth` check or a similar mechanism to limit recursion.
- The application must accept untrusted input that directly dictates the depth or complexity of the Merkle tree. Examples include a list of data elements for tree construction or a Merkle proof for verification.

**Attack Steps**:

1. **Craft Malicious Input**:
    - **For Tree Construction**: The attacker generates an extremely large array of "data" elements (e.g., simple strings or byte slices). The number of elements should be `2^N`, where `N` is a large integer (e.g., `N=22` to `N=25` or higher, depending on the target system's stack size and available memory). Each element can be a lightweight placeholder string (e.g., "A", "B", "C",...). The `buildMerkleTree` example provided in the "Vulnerable Code Snippet" section serves as a direct target for this type of input.
    - **For Proof Verification**: If the vulnerability resides in the Merkle proof verification logic, the attacker crafts a Merkle proof that is excessively long. This might involve constructing a "degenerate" Merkle tree where a single branch is exceptionally deep, or by manipulating the proof structure to force numerous recursive hashing steps. This often involves techniques similar to those used in second preimage attacks, where an intermediate node is made to masquerade as a leaf.24 This manipulated "leaf" can then be extended with a deeply nested structure to trigger extensive recursion during verification.
2. **Submit Malicious Input**: The crafted input is then transmitted to the vulnerable Golang application. This could occur via various channels, such as an exposed API endpoint, a specific network protocol designed for data exchange (e.g., in a blockchain context), or by feeding it into a background processing job that consumes external data.
3. **Observe Impact**: The attacker monitors the target application for signs of distress. A successful PoC will typically result in one or more of the following:
    - The application crashing with a `runtime: goroutine stack exceeds 1GB` (or similar `runtime: goroutine stack` error), which is a clear indication of a stack overflow.
    - The application consuming an extremely high amount of CPU resources and/or memory, leading to severe unresponsiveness or a drastic slowdown in performance, before potentially crashing.
    - The application's logs displaying errors related to resource exhaustion, such as out-of-memory conditions or panic messages.

**Conceptual PoC Code (Attacker Side - demonstrating input generation)**:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	// This PoC generates a large data set to be fed into a vulnerable Merkle tree builder.
	// The actual "attack" happens when the vulnerable application processes this data.

	if len(os.Args) < 2 {
		fmt.Println("Usage: go run poc_generator.go <recursion_depth>")
		fmt.Println("Example: go run poc_generator.go 22 (generates 2^22 elements)")
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	depth, err := strconv.Atoi(os.Args)
	if err!= nil |
| depth <= 0 {
		fmt.Println("Invalid recursion depth. Please provide a positive integer.")
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	numElements := 1 << depth // Calculate 2^depth elements
	fmt.Printf("Generating %d elements for Merkle tree construction (depth %d)...\n", numElements, depth)

	// In a real attack, this data would be sent over a network or written to a file
	// that the target application consumes.
	// For demonstration, we'll just print a sample of the data.
	for i := 0; i < numElements; i++ {
		// Simulate generating actual data. In a real scenario, this could be

		// For simplicity, we create unique strings.
		// fmt.Printf("malicious_data_%d\n", i) // Uncomment to see all data, but it will be huge

		} else if i == 5 {
			fmt.Println("...")
		}
	}
	fmt.Printf("Finished generating %d elements. Now feed this into the vulnerable application.\n", numElements)
}
```

The generation of a PoC is conceptually straightforward: create an arbitrarily large input. However, the complexity lies in understanding the precise impact on the target systemâ€”whether it will primarily affect stack memory, heap memory, or CPUâ€”and tuning the input size to reliably trigger the desired Denial of Service effect. The logarithmic relationship between input size and recursion depth 21 means that while the total input size can be substantial, it is not astronomically large, making the attack practical for an adversary. The relative ease of creating a basic PoC implies that even unsophisticated attackers can launch DoS attacks if this vulnerability exists, underscoring the urgent need for robust defenses.

Furthermore, the PoC highlights that the vulnerability is not solely about the *quantity* of data, but also its *structure*. If the Merkle tree implementation is sensitive to unbalanced trees or allows specific manipulations (such as those in second preimage attacks where intermediate nodes can be interpreted as leaves 24), an attacker might be able to craft a smaller input that still achieves a deep recursion path, making the attack more efficient and harder to detect. Beyond just limiting the total number of elements, implementations should also validate the *shape* and *validity* of the incoming Merkle tree data or proof to prevent structural abuses that could lead to deep recursion.

## Risk Classification

The "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability is classified as **High Risk**. This classification is based on a comprehensive assessment of its potential impact and the likelihood of successful exploitation.

The **Primary Impact** of this vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS), leading directly to system unavailability and severe resource exhaustion, specifically of CPU and memory. The **Secondary Impacts** include significant performance degradation, increased operational costs for recovery and mitigation, severe reputational damage to the affected system or organization, and the potential for cascading failures within complex distributed systems.

The **Likelihood of Exploitation** is considered **High**. The attack is relatively straightforward to execute, requiring only the ability to send a crafted input to the vulnerable system. No special privileges or user interaction are required for a successful attack, as indicated by the CVSS metrics (AV:N, PR:N, UI:N). The logarithmic growth of Merkle tree depth means it is computationally feasible for an attacker to craft inputs that trigger the vulnerability without requiring excessive attacker resources.

This vulnerability maps directly to **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**. This CWE describes a flaw where a system or component allocates or consumes an excessive amount of resources without enforcing proper limits or throttling mechanisms.3 The recurrence of CWE-770 in various Golang vulnerabilities 3 and other software 2 suggests that resource exhaustion is a common and often overlooked attack vector. This trend indicates that developers frequently prioritize functional correctness and data integrity (which Merkle trees are designed to provide) but may neglect the "non-functional" aspects of resource management, especially when dealing with complex data structures and recursive algorithms. Security training for developers should therefore emphasize resource management best practices, particularly for handling untrusted inputs in recursive or iterative processes, as these are frequent sources of DoS vulnerabilities. While less direct, a stack overflow due to unbounded recursion can also be seen as related to **CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow**, as it involves exceeding allocated stack limits, leading to a crash.2

**Affected Systems** include any Golang application that implements Merkle trees or Merkle proof verification and processes untrusted input without proper recursion depth limits. This is particularly critical in:

- **Blockchain Nodes and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs)**: Full nodes, light clients (SPV), and smart contract platforms in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, or custom blockchains, where Merkle trees are fundamental for transaction verification and block integrity.
- **Decentralized Storage and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Systems such as IPFS or similar platforms that rely on Merkle trees for file integrity verification or content addressing.
- **Version Control Systems**: Distributed version control systems that may use Merkle-like structures for tracking changes and ensuring data consistency.15
- **General Data Integrity Services**: Any application where Merkle trees are employed to prove data inclusion or integrity for large datasets.
- **Go Modules and Package Management**: Systems like `gosumdb` in Go, which utilize Merkle trees for module checksum verification, highlight the critical role of Merkle trees in the Go ecosystem, emphasizing the need for robustness in such implementations.33

For systems forming critical infrastructure, such as blockchain nodes or distributed file systems, availability is paramount. A high-likelihood, high-impact DoS attack can severely disrupt operations, leading to significant financial losses, a profound loss of trust, and potential legal repercussions. The historical "quiet fixes" in Bitcoin Core 11 for similar issues underscore the inherent severity of these risks and the industry's desire to mitigate them without drawing undue attention. This vulnerability should be treated with utmost priority, especially in systems that constitute critical infrastructure or handle high-value transactions, where uptime and reliability are non-negotiable.

## Fix & Patch Guidance

Mitigating the "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability requires a multi-faceted approach, focusing on robust coding practices and defensive design patterns in Golang applications.

The most robust solution is to **Implement Explicit Depth Limits**. This involves adding a `depth` parameter to the recursive function and a `maxDepth` parameter to define the recursion limit. Before each recursive call, the current `depth` should be checked against `maxDepth`. If the limit is exceeded, the function should return an error or a default value, preventing further recursion.

**Example (Modified `buildMerkleTree`)**:

```go
func buildMerkleTree(datastring, currentDepth int, maxDepth int) (*MerkleNode, error) {
    if currentDepth > maxDepth {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("merkle tree recursion depth exceeded limit of %d", maxDepth)
    }
    if len(data) == 1 {
        return &MerkleNode{Hash: calculateHash(data), Left: nil, Right: nil}, nil
    }

    mid := len(data) / 2
    left, err := buildMerkleTree(data[:mid], currentDepth+1, maxDepth)
    if err!= nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    right, err := buildMerkleTree(data[mid:], currentDepth+1, maxDepth)
    if err!= nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    combinedHash := calculateHash(left.Hash + right.Hash)
    return &MerkleNode{Hash: combinedHash, Left: left, Right: right}
}

// Example usage in main:
// maxAllowedDepth := 30 // Choose a reasonable, safe limit based on application requirements
// root, err := buildMerkleTree(attackerData, 0, maxAllowedDepth)
// if err!= nil {
//     log.Printf("Error building tree: %v", err)
//     // Handle the error gracefully, e.g., reject the input as malicious
// }
```

The `maxDepth` value should be carefully chosen based on the expected legitimate maximum depth of the Merkle tree for the application's specific use case, plus a small buffer for safety. It must be significantly less than the typical stack limit for a Go routine. For instance, a tree with 2^30 elements (approximately 1 billion) has a depth of 30. If an application is expected to handle millions of elements, a `maxDepth` of 35-40 might be a reasonable and safe limit.

**Robust Input Validation and Canonicalization** are crucial. Before initiating any Merkle tree operation, the size, structure, and logical consistency of the input data must be thoroughly validated. Inputs that are excessively large or malformed in a way that suggests an attack should be rejected outright. Implementations should also enforce canonicalization rules: ensuring that leaf nodes and internal nodes are hashed distinctly. This can be achieved by prepending a unique byte (e.g., `0x00` for leaves, `0x01` for internal nodes) before hashing, or by using different hashing functions or schemes for leaves versus internal nodes. This practice primarily defends against second preimage attacks, where intermediate nodes can masquerade as leaves, but also indirectly prevents unexpected recursion paths or resource consumption that could arise from such structural manipulations. For Merkle proofs, validating the proof length against expected maximums is also essential.

While explicit limits are the primary defense, a **Panic Recovery Mechanism** can serve as a robust fallback. Go's `panic` and `recover` mechanisms can be used to gracefully handle unexpected deep recursion or other runtime errors. Wrapping the recursive function call in a `defer` block with `recover()` allows the application to catch a `panic` (e.g., a stack overflow) without crashing the entire service.

**Example**:

```go
func safeBuildMerkleTreeWrapper(datastring, maxDepth int) (root *MerkleNode, err error) {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r!= nil {
            err = fmt.Errorf("merkle tree operation panicked due to recursion depth: %v", r)
            root = nil // Ensure no partial tree is returned
        }
    }()
    return buildMerkleTree(data, 0, maxDepth)
}
```

This reactive measure enhances application resilience by converting a hard crash into a controlled error, allowing the service to remain operational for other requests.

**Golang Recursion Depth Control Methods**

| Method | Approach | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit Limit | Pass depth parameter | Simple implementation, direct control | Manual tracking required, needs careful `maxDepth` selection |
| Panic Recovery | Exception handling with `defer`/`recover` | Robust error management, prevents full application crash | Performance overhead, reactive (not preventative) |
| Tail Recursion | Restructure recursive calls to minimize stack usage | Memory efficient (in languages supporting TCO) | Limited language support (Go does not guarantee TCO) |

It is important to note that Go's compiler does not guarantee tail call optimization (TCO). This means that even if a recursive function is written in a tail-recursive style, Go's runtime will still allocate a new stack frame for each call, eventually leading to a stack overflow if unbounded. Unlike some other languages where TCO can mitigate stack depth issues, Go developers *must* rely on explicit depth limits or iterative approaches for security-critical recursive functions. TCO is not a reliable security mitigation in Go.

For very large datasets or performance-critical paths, **considering iterative alternatives** to recursive implementations is advisable. While recursion offers elegance, iterative solutions often provide better control over memory usage and inherently avoid stack depth issues.

Finally, **using trusted and audited libraries** is a best practice. Whenever possible, developers should opt for well-vetted and security-audited Merkle tree libraries. For example, OpenZeppelin's MerkleProof for Solidity follows best practices. If a third-party Go library is used, its handling of recursion depth and input validation should be thoroughly verified. If custom code is necessary, it must undergo rigorous security review and penetration testing.

## Scope and Impact

The "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability has a broad scope, potentially affecting a wide array of systems that rely on Merkle trees, and can lead to severe consequences upon successful exploitation.

The **Scope of Affected Systems** is extensive, particularly within distributed computing environments:

- **Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs)**: This includes any blockchain node, distributed ledger, or cryptocurrency application written in Golang that utilizes Merkle trees for transaction verification and data integrity. Examples include full nodes, light clients (Simplified Payment Verification or SPV), and services interacting with smart contract platforms where Merkle proofs are verified either on-chain or off-chain by Go services.
- **Decentralized Storage and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Systems like IPFS or other decentralized storage solutions and CDNs that employ Merkle trees for file integrity verification or content addressing are susceptible.
- **Version Control Systems**: Distributed version control systems that may use Merkle-like structures for tracking changes and ensuring the integrity of codebases.15
- **Data Integrity Services**: Any application where Merkle trees are used to prove data inclusion or integrity for large, mutable, or distributed datasets.
- **Go Modules and Package Management**: Critical infrastructure components such as `gosumdb` in Go, which leverage Merkle trees for module checksum verification, highlight the fundamental role of Merkle trees in the Go ecosystem and the necessity for their robust implementation.33

The impact of exploitation extends beyond immediate technical failures:

- **Service Unavailability**: The primary and most direct impact is a Denial of Service (DoS), rendering the affected application or service completely unavailable. For critical infrastructure like blockchain networks, this can halt transaction processing, block propagation, and network synchronization, severely disrupting the entire network.
- **Resource Depletion**: A successful attack leads to the exhaustion of server CPU, memory, and potentially network bandwidth. This results in degraded performance for other services running on the same host or within the same network segment.
- **Financial Loss**: Downtime caused by a DoS attack can result in significant financial losses for businesses and organizations that rely on the affected service. For blockchain projects, this could mean lost transaction fees, delayed operations, or a broader loss of confidence in the network's reliability.
- **Reputational Damage**: A DoS attack erodes user trust and can severely damage the reputation of the project, product, or organization responsible for the vulnerable system.
- **Cascading Failures**: In complex distributed systems, the crash of one node due to a DoS can trigger cascading failures across the network, leading to widespread disruption. For instance, if a full node crashes, light clients relying on it might lose connectivity and functionality.10
- **Increased Operational Costs**: Recovery from a DoS attack incurs significant operational effort and costs, including incident response, system restarts, forensic analysis, and potentially scaling up resources to withstand or mitigate future attacks.

The criticality of Merkle trees in distributed systems elevates the severity of this vulnerability beyond a typical application crash. Merkle trees are fundamental to distributed systems like blockchains precisely because they enable efficient and verifiable data distribution. However, a vulnerability in a core component like Merkle tree processing can have a disproportionately large impact due to the interconnected nature of these systems. A DoS on one node can affect its peers, propagate across the network, and impact the entire ecosystem. This represents a "network effect" of vulnerability, where a localized flaw can threaten the very stability and integrity of the entire decentralized network.

It is also noteworthy that some Merkle tree vulnerabilities in Bitcoin Core were "quietly fixed without ever being exploited".11 While such discreet remediation might seem positive, it can also imply a potential lack of transparency or delayed public disclosure, which can hinder broader awareness and learning within the developer community. If vulnerabilities are not fully disclosed and analyzed, similar flaws might reappear in new implementations or other projects, perpetuating the risk. The security community generally benefits from transparent disclosure and detailed post-mortems of vulnerabilities, even those that were "quietly fixed," to prevent recurrence and foster better security practices across the industry.

## Remediation Recommendation

Addressing the "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability requires a comprehensive and prioritized set of remediation actions, forming a robust defense-in-depth strategy.

The foremost recommendation is to **Prioritize Explicit Recursion Depth Limits**. All Merkle tree construction and verification functions in Golang applications must be immediately reviewed. For any function that employs recursion and processes untrusted input, an explicit `maxDepth` parameter must be implemented and enforced as a base case. This is the most direct and effective mitigation against stack overflow and uncontrolled resource consumption, providing a hard boundary for recursive calls.

Secondly, **Implement Robust Input Validation**. Before any Merkle tree operation commences, the size, format, and logical structure of the input data (e.g., number of elements, length of proof) must be rigorously validated. Inputs that exceed reasonable limits or appear malformed should be rejected promptly. This acts as a crucial first line of defense, preventing malicious or excessively large inputs from even reaching the recursive processing logic.

A critical step is to **Adopt Canonicalization for Merkle Tree Hashing**. Implementations should ensure that leaf nodes and internal nodes are hashed distinctly. This can be achieved by prepending a unique byte (e.g., `0x00` for leaves, `0x01` for internal nodes) before hashing, or by using different hashing functions or schemes for leaves versus internal nodes. While primarily a defense against second preimage attacks, canonicalization prevents an attacker from making an intermediate node masquerade as a leaf, which could otherwise be leveraged to create unexpected and deep recursive paths during verification, indirectly contributing to resource exhaustion.

Organizations should **Utilize Trusted and Audited Libraries** whenever possible. Opting for well-established, security-audited Merkle tree libraries over custom implementations is highly recommended. Mature libraries are more likely to have already addressed common pitfalls like recursion limits and input validation, benefiting from collective security expertise. If custom code is unavoidable, it must undergo rigorous security review and penetration testing.

As a safety net, **Implement Panic Recovery**. For critical recursive functions, `defer` with `recover()` blocks should be implemented to gracefully handle unexpected panics, such as stack overflows, without crashing the entire application. While not a primary prevention, this mechanism significantly enhances application resilience by converting a hard crash into a controlled error, allowing the service to remain operational for other requests.

**Continuous Monitoring and Alerting** are essential for proactive defense. Comprehensive monitoring solutions (e.g., Prometheus, OpenTelemetry) should be deployed to track CPU, memory, and stack usage of Golang applications in real-time.31 Setting up alerts for unusual spikes or prolonged high resource consumption enables early detection of ongoing Denial of Service attacks or performance degradation, facilitating rapid incident response.

Finally, **Regular Security Audits and Fuzz Testing** are crucial. Conduct regular security audits, including manual code reviews specifically focusing on recursive logic and input handling. Implement continuous fuzz testing of Merkle tree processing components with various malformed and oversized inputs. Proactive testing helps uncover vulnerabilities that might be missed by static analysis or standard functional testing.

The combination of these recommendations forms a robust defense-in-depth strategy. Input validation serves as the outermost layer, preventing malformed data from entering the system. Explicit limits provide the core protective layer for recursion. Canonicalization adds structural integrity to the data processing. Panic recovery acts as an innermost safety net. Monitoring provides external visibility into system health. This layered approach is critical because no single mitigation is foolproof.

The recurring nature of resource exhaustion vulnerabilities, often stemming from a lack of explicit limits or trusting input, points to a gap in developer awareness regarding resource management in recursive algorithms. The fact that standard Go static analysis tools like `go vet` do not reliably catch these issues 28 further emphasizes the need for manual diligence. Organizations should therefore invest in developer training focused on secure coding practices, particularly for handling untrusted inputs, managing recursion, and understanding potential resource-based attacks.

## Summary

The "No limit on Merkle recursion" vulnerability in Golang Merkle tree implementations poses a significant Denial of Service (DoS) risk. This flaw, frequently arising from the absence of explicit depth limits in recursive functions, enables an attacker to craft malicious inputs that exhaust system resources, leading to application crashes or severe performance degradation. Such vulnerabilities are particularly critical in distributed systems like blockchains, where Merkle trees are fundamental for ensuring data integrity and facilitating efficient verification.

The core of the issue lies in unchecked recursive calls during Merkle tree construction or proof verification. Each recursive call consumes stack memory, and while Go's goroutines feature dynamically growing stacks, this growth is not infinite. Unbounded recursion will ultimately exhaust available memory, leading to a runtime panic and system termination. Historical precedents in major projects like Bitcoin, which have experienced and quietly fixed similar Merkle tree-related resource exhaustion issues, underscore the pervasive nature and critical importance of addressing this class of vulnerability.

Effective remediation necessitates a multi-faceted approach. The primary defense involves prioritizing the implementation of explicit recursion depth limits within all recursive Merkle tree functions. This must be complemented by rigorous validation of all untrusted inputs to prevent malicious data from triggering deep recursion. Adopting canonical hashing rules for Merkle tree elements, such as distinct hashing for leaf and internal nodes, is also crucial to prevent structural abuses that could indirectly lead to resource exhaustion. Leveraging trusted, security-audited libraries, where available, is highly recommended. Additionally, implementing a panic recovery mechanism serves as a vital safety net, allowing applications to gracefully handle unexpected panics without complete service disruption. Continuous monitoring and robust logging are indispensable for detecting ongoing attacks and performance degradation, enabling rapid incident response. Developers must be educated on the critical importance of secure resource management in recursive algorithms, recognizing that automated static analysis tools may not always identify these subtle yet impactful flaws. By adopting these best practices, organizations can significantly enhance the resilience and availability of their Golang applications against this pervasive threat.
