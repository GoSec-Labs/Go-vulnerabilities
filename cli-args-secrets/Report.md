# **CLI Tools Exposing Secrets via Command-Line Arguments (cli-args-secrets)**

## **Severity Rating**

Overall Severity: **MediumðŸŸ¡ to HighðŸŸ **.

The severity of exposing secrets via command-line arguments is context-dependent, primarily influenced by two factors: the sensitivity of the exposed secret and the accessibility of the environment in which the Command Line Interface (CLI) tool operates. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 vector can be used to illustrate a baseline, for example: `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`, which yields a score of 6.2 (Medium). However, this score can escalate significantly based on specific circumstances.

The components of this baseline CVSS vector are justified as follows:

| **CVSS Metric** | **Selected Value** | **Justification for cli-args-secrets** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attack Vector (AV) | Local (L) | The attacker typically requires local access to the system to inspect process lists (e.g., using `ps`), shell history files, or local log files where arguments might be stored. |
| Attack Complexity (AC) | Low (L) | Discovering exposed arguments is generally straightforward for an individual with local access and knowledge of common system utilities or file locations for shell history. |
| Privileges Required (PR) | Low (L) | Standard user privileges are often sufficient to view one's own process arguments or shell history. Accessing other users' process information might require higher privileges, but system-wide logs or insecurely stored history could lower this barrier. |
| User Interaction (UI) | None (N) | No interaction from a legitimate user is required beyond their normal execution of the CLI tool with the secret argument. The exposure happens as a byproduct of this legitimate operation. |
| Scope (S) | Unchanged (U) | The vulnerability (exposure of the argument) typically does not allow the attacker to directly affect components beyond the security scope managed by the vulnerable component itself. The impact is on the confidentiality of the secret. |
| Confidentiality (C) | High (H) | If the exposed secrets are critical, such as API keys with broad permissions, database root passwords, private encryption keys, or administrative credentials, the impact on confidentiality is high. |
| Integrity (I) | None (N) | The act of exposing the argument itself does not directly impact the integrity of systems or data. Subsequent actions using the compromised secret might, but that is a secondary effect. |
| Availability (A) | None (N) | The act of exposing the argument itself does not directly impact the availability of systems or services. Subsequent actions using the compromised secret might. |

The severity rating is not static; it is highly contextual. The potential impact of a compromised secret is a primary driver. For instance, a read-only API key for a non-critical internal service carries a lower risk than a master database credential or a cloud platform administrative key. The environment also plays a crucial role. A script run by a privileged user on a dedicated, isolated server has a different exposure profile than a user-level script executed on a shared development machine or in an environment where logs are aggregated without sufficient access controls.

While the typical attack vector is local, this can be misleading if downstream data handling practices are not thoroughly evaluated. The immediate vulnerability is indeed the local exposure of the argument. However, if these command-line arguments are captured in logs, as warned in , and these logs are subsequently transmitted to a centralized logging system with inadequate access controls, the secret effectively becomes remotely accessible to any entity that can access those logs. This creates a chain of events: local CLI argument leads to process information or local log entry, which, if handled insecurely (e.g., insecure log aggregation or storage), results in potential remote exposure. This broader implication means the true attack surface might be wider than initially perceived by focusing solely on local system access. Consequently, developers and security teams might underestimate the risk by neglecting these "ripple effects."

## **Description**

Go-based Command Line Interface (CLI) tools can inadvertently expose sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, authentication tokens, or other confidential credentials, when these secrets are supplied directly as command-line arguments during program execution. When a program is launched, its command-line arguments become part of its process information, which can often be inspected by other users or processes operating on the same system. Standard operating system utilities, like `ps` on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) or Task Manager on Windows, can reveal these arguments to users with appropriate permissions.

Furthermore, interactive command-line shells (e.g., Bash, Zsh, PowerShell) commonly maintain a history of executed commands, including their arguments. This history is typically stored in plaintext files (e.g., `.bash_history` on systems using Bash). If secrets are embedded within these commands, they persist in these history files, potentially long after the CLI tool has finished executing. This exposure creates a significant risk that sensitive data can be illegitimately accessed by any individual or process with the ability to view process details, read shell history files, or access system or application logs that might capture command invocations.*

This vulnerability represents a common form of information exposure, specifically CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. The fundamental issue is the lack of confidentiality for data transmitted via this channel. The convenience of passing all parameters, including secrets, via CLI arguments for scripting or ease of use directly conflicts with the security principles required for handling sensitive credentials. This often leads to developers unintentionally creating this vulnerability, especially when the full implications of argument visibility are not considered.

## **Technical Description (for security pros)**

The exposure of secrets passed as command-line arguments is a consequence of standard operating system behaviors and shell functionalities, which Go applications interact with through argument parsing mechanisms.

**Process Information Exposure**: When any executable, including a Go application, is launched, the operating system kernel records the full command line used for invocation, along with all its arguments. On Unix-like systems, this information is commonly accessible via the `/proc` filesystem. Specifically, the `/proc/<PID>/cmdline` file for a given Process ID (PID) contains the command and its arguments, typically separated by null characters. Utilities like `ps` parse this kernel-provided data to display process information. On Windows systems, APIs such as `GetCommandLineW` provide access to this information, which can be viewed through tools like Task Manager or via PowerShell cmdlets like `Get-Process`, which can display the command line for running processes.

**Shell History Persistence**: Interactive shells are designed to enhance user productivity by maintaining a history of commands. Shells like Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell log executed commands, including all arguments, to history files (e.g., `~/.bash_history`, `~/.zsh_history`, or specific locations for PowerShell history). These history files store commands in plaintext and persist across user sessions and system reboots, meaning secrets passed in commands remain exposed long after the process has terminated.

**Go Argument Parsing**: Go applications typically use the standard `flag` package or popular third-party libraries such as `spf13/cobra` and `urfave/cli` to define and parse command-line arguments. It is important to note that these libraries themselves are not inherently flawed; they function as designed by providing a structured way to access the arguments passed to the program. The vulnerability arises when developers use these mechanisms to accept secret data. Direct parsing of the `os.Args` slice, which contains all command-line arguments with `os.Args` being the program name, is also a common practice in Go.

**Memory Residency**: Secrets passed as arguments are loaded into the application's memory space. They will be part of the `os.Args` slice and subsequently copied into variables by parsing libraries. While direct memory inspection of a running process requires specific privileges and tools (like debuggers or memory dumping utilities), the primary and more accessible exposure vector for this vulnerability is the OS-level and shell-level visibility of the arguments as process metadata and historical records, rather than sophisticated memory forensics.

**Log-Based Exposure**: Secrets can also be exposed if application or system logging mechanisms are configured to record full command executions or process startup events along with their arguments. Furthermore, unhandled errors or verbose debugging output, if not carefully managed, might inadvertently include command-line arguments containing secrets in log files. These logs can persist secrets on disk or transmit them to centralized logging systems, potentially broadening the attack surface if these systems are not adequately secured.

The core technical issue is that command-line arguments are treated by the OS as public metadata for a process. Go's argument parsing tools provide convenient access to this data, but they do not, and cannot, alter this fundamental OS behavior. The persistence of these arguments in shell history files significantly extends the window of exposure beyond the runtime of the process itself, creating a lasting artifact that can be discovered later. The design of Go's `flag` package and the `os.Args` slice, which present arguments as simple strings, makes it easy for developers to assign a secret to a string variable without any inherent "taint" or warning about its sensitivity, thus facilitating this insecure practice.

## **Common Mistakes That Cause This**

The exposure of secrets via command-line arguments in Go applications typically stems from a series of common mistakes and oversights made during development and deployment:

1. **Prioritizing Convenience for Scripting and Automation**: Developers often design CLIs to accept secrets as arguments to simplify automated execution in scripts or CI/CD pipelines. While this offers ease of use, it directly trades security for convenience, as providing or enforcing more secure methods for secret injection (like environment variables or temporary files) is overlooked.
2. **Developer Unawareness or Oversight**: A frequent cause is a lack of complete understanding among developers that command-line arguments are generally insecure for sensitive data. The visibility of arguments in system process lists and shell history files is a critical detail that may not be widely known or considered.
    
3. **Misapplication of Argument-Passing Patterns**: Developers may use the same design patternâ€”flags or positional argumentsâ€”for handling secrets as they do for non-sensitive configuration parameters like port numbers, verbosity flags, or input/output file paths. This uniform approach fails to account for the distinct security requirements of sensitive data.
4. **Incomplete or Inadequate Threat Modeling**: Failing to consider local users (on multi-user systems), other processes running under the same user account, or system administrators as potential unauthorized viewers of process information or shell history contributes to this vulnerability. Additionally, the risks associated with centralized logging systems capturing command lines are often underestimated.
5. **Hardcoding Secrets in Wrapper Scripts or CI/CD Pipelines**: It is common for wrapper scripts (e.g., shell scripts, Python scripts) or CI/CD pipeline configurations to invoke the Go CLI tool with secrets hardcoded directly into the command string (e.g., `mygocli --apikey=VERY_SECRET_KEY`). This practice makes the secret visible both within the script/pipeline definition and in the process list when the Go CLI is executed. Storing secrets in CI/CD configuration files or echoing them in build logs are related anti-patterns.
    
6. **Neglecting Secure Alternatives**: A significant mistake is not implementing or promoting more secure methods for secret provisioning. These alternatives include reading secrets from environment variables (while being mindful of their own exposure risks ), using dedicated configuration files with strict file system permissions, integrating with specialized secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) , or employing interactive prompts for user-supplied credentials where the input is not echoed to the screen.

    
7. **Excessive or Unscrubbed Logging Practices**: Application or system logs that are configured to capture full command-line arguments, or error reporting mechanisms that dump extensive process state information including arguments, can inadvertently persist secrets to storage.
    
8. **Copy-Pasting Example Code or Following Insecure Tutorials**: Developers might adopt insecure practices by copying example CLI usage from documentation, tutorials, or online forums that (incorrectly) demonstrate passing secrets via arguments, without critically evaluating the security implications of such examples.

These mistakes often reflect a human factor where convenience, rapid development pressures, or a lack of specific security knowledge regarding CLI argument exposure leads to insecure choices. Systemically, these errors can indicate gaps in secure development training programs or the absence of clear organizational best practices for secret management in CLI applications. A recurring theme is the underestimation of "local" threats; developers may rigorously secure network communications but overlook vulnerabilities exploitable by an entity already present on the system or with access to system logs.

## **Exploitation Goals**

The primary goal of exploiting exposed command-line arguments is the **confidentiality compromise** through **information disclosure**: the attacker aims to acquire the sensitive secrets being passed. These secrets can include API keys, passwords, session tokens, private encryption keys, database connection strings, or any other form of credential.

Once a secret is successfully obtained, secondary goals can be pursued by actively using the stolen credential. These often include:

- **Unauthorized Access**: Leveraging the compromised credentials to gain illicit entry into systems, applications, services, databases, cloud provider environments (such as AWS, Azure, GCP), or other protected resources. The scope of access depends entirely on the permissions associated with the stolen secret.
- **Privilege Escalation**: If the stolen secret belongs to an account with elevated privileges (e.g., an administrator user, a service account with broad permissions), the attacker can use this secret to escalate their privileges, either on the local system where the CLI tool was run or within the target environment accessed by the secret.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Accessing and illicitly transferring sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial records, intellectual property, or health records, that is protected by or accessible via the compromised secret.
- **Lateral Movement**: Using the initial access gained from the stolen secret as a pivot point to compromise other systems, services, or accounts within the same network or cloud environment. This expands the attacker's foothold.
- **Impersonation and Session Hijacking**: Acting as the legitimate user or service associated with the stolen credentials. This could involve hijacking active sessions if session tokens are exposed, or initiating new authenticated sessions.
- **Service Disruption or Denial of Service (DoS)**: If the compromised secret grants control over critical infrastructure components or administrative functions, an attacker might intentionally disrupt services or cause a denial of service.
    
- **Further System Compromise**: Utilizing the gained access to install malware, create persistent backdoors, alter configurations to weaken security, or otherwise compromise the integrity and security of the affected systems.

The exploitation path is typically a two-stage process. The first stage involves passive observation or retrieval of the exposed secret from the process list, shell history, or logs. The second stage involves the active use of this secret to achieve one or more of the secondary goals listed above. The ease of the first stage (discovery) is often high for an attacker with the requisite access, and the value of the exploit (the impact of the second stage) directly correlates with the power and permissions granted by the compromised secret. A secret for a development environment might be less immediately critical than one for a production system, but it could still provide valuable information for reconnaissance or serve as a stepping stone in a more complex attack. This vulnerability can thus be an initial access vector that enables more severe subsequent attacks, bypassing other security controls if the leaked credential provides a direct path to sensitive assets.

## **Affected Components or Files**

The vulnerability of exposing secrets via command-line arguments affects a range of components and file system artifacts, extending beyond the Go application itself into the operating system and user environment.

- **Go CLI Applications**: The primary component is any Go application designed as a command-line tool that is architected to receive sensitive data (such as passwords, API keys, or authentication tokens) directly through its command-line arguments.
- **Go Argument Parsing Mechanisms**:
    - Code that utilizes Go's standard `flag` package for defining and parsing arguments (e.g., `flag.String()`, `flag.Int()`, `flag.Bool()` when used for secret values).
        
    - Applications built with popular third-party CLI frameworks such as `spf13/cobra`  or `urfave/cli`, if flags or arguments defined using these frameworks are designated to accept secrets.
        
    - Go code that directly parses the `os.Args` slice to retrieve secrets from command-line arguments.
        
- **Operating System Process Information Stores**:
    - **Linux**: The `/proc/<PID>/cmdline` file for each running process, which contains the null-terminated arguments.
    - **macOS and other Unix-like systems**: Kernel-level data structures that store process arguments and are queried by system utilities like `ps`.
    - **Windows**: Process information accessible through Windows API functions (e.g., `GetCommandLineW`) and viewable via tools such as Task Manager (when the "Command line" column is enabled in the Details tab) or PowerShell cmdlets (e.g., `Get-Process | Select-Object CommandLine`).
- **Shell History Files**: These files store a record of commands executed in the shell, including arguments:
    - **Bash**: Typically `~/.bash_history`.
    - **Zsh**: Typically `~/.zsh_history` or the path specified by the `$HISTFILE` environment variable.
    - **Fish**: Typically `~/.local/share/fish/fish_history`.
    - **PowerShell**: History is managed by the `PSReadLine` module and stored in a file (e.g., `Get-PSReadLineOption | Select-Object -ExpandProperty HistorySavePath`).
- **Log Files**: Various types of logs can capture command-line arguments:
    - **System Logs**: Logs such as syslog or journald on Linux might record process creation events with full command lines if verbosely configured.
    - **Application-Specific Logs**: Logs generated by the Go CLI tool itself or by related services, if they are configured to log command invocations, unhandled errors that might dump argument data, or verbose debugging information.
        
    - **CI/CD Pipeline Execution Logs**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment systems often echo the commands being executed during build and deployment jobs, potentially exposing secrets if they are passed as arguments.
        
- **Automation Scripts and Orchestration Tools**:
    - Wrapper scripts (e.g., Shell, Python) that invoke the Go CLI tool and embed secrets directly in the command-line call.
    - Configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) or container orchestration manifests (e.g., Kubernetes Job or Pod specifications) that define how the Go CLI tool is executed, if they pass secrets as command-line arguments.

The scope of this vulnerability is therefore broad, encompassing not just the Go application's source code but also integral parts of the operating system, user environment configurations, logging infrastructure, and automation workflows that interact with the CLI tool. The specific Go library chosen for argument parsing (e.g., `flag`, `cobra`) is an implementation detail regarding *how* the arguments are consumed by the Go application. The fundamental vulnerability arises from the *design decision* to accept secrets via this inherently public channel, irrespective of the parsing library employed.

## **Vulnerable Code Snippet**

The following Go program illustrates how secrets can be vulnerably passed as command-line arguments using the standard `flag` package. This pattern is common but insecure.

```Go

package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	// "os" // Not strictly needed for this minimal PoC, but often used for exit codes.
)

func main() {
	// VULNERABLE: Defining a flag to accept an API key.
	// Secrets passed this way are visible in process lists (e.g., via `ps aux`)
	// and can be stored in shell history files (e.g., ~/.bash_history).
	apiKey := flag.String("api-key", "", "Service API Key (Example: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE - DO NOT USE REAL SECRETS IN PRODUCTION VIA CLI ARGS)")

	// VULNERABLE: Defining another flag for a database password.
	// Similar exposure risks apply.
	dbPassword := flag.String("db-password", "", "Database Password (Example: MyS3curEPa$$w0rd - DO NOT USE REAL SECRETS IN PRODUCTION VIA CLI ARGS)")

	// It's crucial to call flag.Parse() to process the defined flags
	// from the command line arguments provided when the program is run.
	flag.Parse()

	// Example usage of the potentially exposed secrets.
	// In a real application, these would be used to authenticate to services,
	// connect to databases, etc.
	if *apiKey!= "" {
		fmt.Printf("Attempting to use (potentially exposed) API Key: %s\n", *apiKey)
		// Placeholder for actual logic: connectToApiService(*apiKey)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("API Key not provided via --api-key flag.")
	}

	if *dbPassword!= "" {
		fmt.Printf("Attempting to use (potentially exposed) Database Password: %s\n", *dbPassword)
		// Placeholder for actual logic: connectToDatabase(*dbPassword)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Database password not provided via --db-password flag.")
	}

	// Display any non-flag arguments (positional arguments)
	// These are arguments provided after all flags have been parsed.
	if len(flag.Args()) > 0 {
		fmt.Println("Other arguments provided:", flag.Args())
	} else {
		fmt.Println("No other positional arguments provided.")
	}

	// Example of how this vulnerable CLI might be invoked:
	//./vulnerablecliapp --api-key="MY_VERY_SECRET_API_KEY_12345" --db-password="MyExtremelySecureDbPass@2024!" some_other_arg
	// In this invocation, both "MY_VERY_SECRET_API_KEY_12345" and "MyExtremelySecureDbPass@2024!"
	// would be visible in process listings and shell history.
}
```

This code snippet uses `flag.String()` from Go's standard library to define command-line flags named `api-key` and `db-password`. The comments within the code explicitly highlight the vulnerability associated with this practice. When this program is compiled and executed with sensitive data supplied to these flags, that data becomes susceptible to exposure through system process monitoring tools and shell history logs. The `flag` package itself functions correctly by parsing the provided arguments; the vulnerability is introduced by the developer's design choice to use this mechanism for handling secret data, rather than employing more secure alternatives. This type of simple, direct code is common and makes it easy for developers to inadvertently introduce the vulnerability, especially if they are not fully aware of the exposure risks associated with command-line arguments.

## **Detection Steps**

Detecting the exposure of secrets via command-line arguments in Go applications requires a multi-faceted approach, combining static analysis of the codebase with dynamic runtime verification and operational audits.

| **Detection Method** | **Description & Focus** | **Tools/Techniques** | **Stage in SDLC** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Manual Code Review** | Inspect Go source code for usage of `flag` package functions (e.g., `flag.String`), direct `os.Args` parsing, or third-party CLI libraries (`cobra`, `urfave/cli`) where defined flags/arguments are intended for secrets (judged by name or context). | Manual inspection, code search for keywords like "password", "apikey", "secret", "token" in conjunction with argument parsing code. | Development, Review |
| **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** | Use SAST tools with rules to detect patterns of sensitive data types or keywords associated with command-line argument parsing. May flag argument usage as a "security hotspot" requiring review. | SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, Semgrep, commercial SAST solutions), custom linters. | Development, CI/CD |
| **Dynamic Process Inspection (Runtime)** | Execute the CLI tool in a controlled (test/dev) environment with dummy secrets. Inspect the system's process list to see if arguments are visible. | Linux/macOS: `ps aux \ | grep <tool>`,`cat /proc/<PID>/cmdline`. Windows: Task Manager (Details tab, "Command line" column), PowerShell`Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "name = '<tool>.exe'" \ |
| **Shell History Analysis (Runtime)** | After executing the CLI tool with dummy secrets, check shell history files for the command and its arguments. | `history \ | grep <tool>`,`cat ~/.bash_history \ |
| **Log File Auditing (Operational)** | Review application logs, system logs (syslog, journald), and CI/CD pipeline logs for captured command-line invocations that might include secrets. | Log analysis tools (Splunk, ELK Stack), manual log inspection, `grep`. | Testing, Production |
| **Repository Secret Scanning** | Scan code repositories and Git history for hardcoded secrets, which might include secrets in example CLI invocations or wrapper scripts that call the CLI. | Tools like `detect-secrets`, `gitleaks`, `trufflehog`, `endorctl scan --secrets --git-logs`. | Development, CI/CD |
| **Documentation Review** | Examine user manuals, developer guides, and API documentation for instructions or examples that advise passing secrets via CLI arguments. | Manual review of documentation. | Development, Release |

A comprehensive detection strategy leverages these methods in combination. Static analysis can identify the *potential* for the vulnerability by finding where arguments intended for secrets are defined in the code. Dynamic analysis, such as process inspection and shell history checks, *confirms* the actual exposure of these secrets during execution in a specific environment. Log review helps find *persistent records* of exposed secrets that might have been captured operationally.

One challenge in automated detection is the semantic nature of what constitutes a "secret." A SAST tool might easily identify all uses of `flag.String`, but it cannot definitively determine if the string variable `myFlag` is intended to hold a password or a non-sensitive configuration value without contextual clues, such as the flag's name (e.g., `--password`, `--apiKey`) or how the variable is subsequently used. This often means that findings from automated tools require manual validation to differentiate between actual vulnerabilities and false positives. Therefore, integrating these detection steps into various phases of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)â€”SAST and manual reviews during development, dynamic checks during testing, and continuous monitoring of logs in productionâ€”is crucial for effectively catching and preventing this vulnerability.

## **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how secrets passed as command-line arguments to a Go CLI tool can be exposed.

1. **Setup**:
    - Save the Go code from the "Vulnerable Code Snippet" section (Section 8) into a file named `vulnerablecli.go`.
    - Compile the Go program using the Go compiler:
    
    This command creates an executable file named `vulnerablecli` in the current directory.

        ```Bash
        
        `go build -o vulnerablecli vulnerablecli.go`
        ```
        
2. **Execution with Secrets**:
    - Run the compiled CLI tool from your terminal, providing dummy (but identifiable) secrets for the `api-key` and `db-password` flags:
    
    ./vulnerablecli --api-key="CmdLineApiKey123ForPoC" --db-password="SuperSecretPassword789PoC" an_extra_arg
    
    ```
    
3. **Observation - Process List**:
    - While the `vulnerablecli` program is running (or immediately after for very short-lived processes), open another terminal window.
    - On Linux or macOS, execute the following command to list processes and filter for `vulnerablecli`:
        
        ```Bash
        
        `ps aux | grep vulnerablecli`
        ```
        
    - **Expected Output (or similar)**: You should observe output that includes the command line used to launch the program, clearly showing the secrets:
    
    The values `CmdLineApiKey123ForPoC` and `SuperSecretPassword789PoC` are plainly visible.
        
        `youruser  12345   0.0  0.0  1234560  12340 pts/2    S+   10:30   0:00./vulnerablecli --api-key=CmdLineApiKey123ForPoC --db-password=SuperSecretPassword789PoC an_extra_arg`
        
    - **Alternative (Linux specific)**: If you can identify the Process ID (PID) of `vulnerablecli` (e.g., 12345 from the `ps` output), you can inspect its command line directly from the `/proc` filesystem:
    
    This will output the command and arguments separated by null characters (represented here as `^@` for clarity):
    `./vulnerablecli^@--api-key=CmdLineApiKey123ForPoC^@--db-password=SuperSecretPassword789PoC^@an_extra_arg^@`
    
        ```Bash
        
        `cat /proc/12345/cmdline; echo`
        ```
        
4. **Observation - Shell History**:
    - After the `vulnerablecli` command has finished executing, check your shell's command history. For Bash, you can use:
        
        ```Bash
        
        `history | grep vulnerablecli`
        ```
        
    - **Expected Output**: Your shell history will likely contain the exact command you typed, including the dummy secrets:
        
          `501 ./vulnerablecli --api-key="CmdLineApiKey123ForPoC" --db-password="SuperSecretPassword789PoC" an_extra_arg`
        

This PoC effectively demonstrates the core vulnerability: secrets passed as command-line arguments are exposed in plaintext in both the system's process list (making them visible to other users or processes with sufficient permissions on the same system ) and in the user's shell history (making them persistently available). The ease with which this information can be retrieved using standard system utilities underscores that no sophisticated hacking tools are required for an attacker with local access to discover these exposed secrets. This simplicity lowers the barrier for exploitation and makes this vulnerability a practical concern.

## **Risk Classification**

The exposure of secrets via command-line arguments can be classified using standard industry frameworks to understand its nature and severity.

- **CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)**:
    - **Primary: CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials**. This is the most direct classification, as the practice of passing secrets in CLI arguments inherently fails to provide adequate protection against their observation by unauthorized parties.
    - **Secondary: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. This CWE broadly applies because the secrets (sensitive information) become visible in process listings, shell history, and potentially logs, making them accessible to unauthorized actors.

    - **Supporting: CWE-214: Information Exposure Through Process Environment**. This is a more specific type of CWE-200, directly relating to information, including command-line arguments, exposed via the process environment.
        
- OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Categories (Related Principles):
    
    While OWASP Top 10 primarily focuses on web applications, the underlying principles are relevant:
    
    - **OWASP Top 10 2021 - A01: Broken Access Control**: If the compromised credentials lead to unauthorized access to systems or data.
    - **OWASP Top 10 2021 - A05: Security Misconfiguration**: Designing a CLI tool to accept secrets via an insecure channel like command-line arguments can be considered a security misconfiguration.
    - **OWASP Top 10 2021 - A07: Identification and Authentication Failures**: If the stolen credentials are used to bypass authentication mechanisms or impersonate legitimate users/services.
    - This practice directly violates principles outlined in the **OWASP Secrets Management Cheat Sheet** , which advocates for secure storage, transmission, and handling of secrets, explicitly discouraging practices that lead to their exposure.
        
- **Risk Factors**:
    - **Likelihood of Discovery**:
        - **High** for local attackers, users on shared systems, or any process running with sufficient privileges to inspect other processes or read shell history files.
        - **Low** for remote attackers *unless* they have already gained initial access to the system through other means, or if logs containing these arguments are insecurely transmitted or stored where they can be remotely accessed.
    - **Likelihood of Exploit**:
        - **High**, if a secret is discovered. Using a compromised credential typically requires no special skill beyond having the credential itself. The secrets are often in plaintext and ready to use.
    - **Impact**:
        - **Medium to Critical**, highly dependent on:
            - The sensitivity of the exposed secret (e.g., a read-only debug token vs. a production database administrator password).
            - The permissions and access granted by the compromised secret.
            - The security posture of the systems accessible via the secret.

The risk associated with this vulnerability is amplified because the exposed credentials are often in a ready-to-use plaintext format. Unlike hashed passwords, which require computational effort to crack, API keys, tokens, or passwords passed as CLI arguments are typically in their directly usable form. This significantly reduces the effort and time needed for an attacker to exploit them once discovered. Misclassifying this vulnerability solely as "low risk" due to the "local access" prerequisite can be a dangerous oversight. Local access is a common scenario in many threat models, including insider threats, compromised user accounts on shared systems, or as a post-exploitation step after an initial breach. Furthermore, as previously noted, insecure logging practices can escalate the exposure from local to potentially remote, thereby altering the likelihood of discovery.

## **Fix & Patch Guidance**

The fundamental resolution for the `cli-args-secrets` vulnerability is to **stop accepting secrets directly as command-line arguments**. This is an architectural and design change within the Go CLI application, rather than a "patch" applied to a library like `flag` or `os.Args`, as these are functioning as intended by providing access to the arguments.

**Core Code Modifications**:

1. **Remove Secret-Accepting Flags/Arguments**: Identify and remove flag definitions (e.g., those using `flag.String()`, `flag.Int()`, or equivalent functions in libraries like `spf13/cobra`) that are intended to receive passwords, API keys, tokens, or other forms of secret data.
2. **Refactor Secret Ingestion Logic**: Modify the application's logic to retrieve secrets from more secure sources. Refer to the "Remediation Recommendation" section (Section 14) for specific alternative methods.

**Immediate Actions for Existing Systems and Users**:

1. **Identify Vulnerable CLI Tools**: Conduct thorough audits of all Go CLI applications using the methods described in the "Detection Steps" section (Section 9) to identify instances where secrets are passed as arguments.
2. **Rotate ALL Exposed Secrets**: Any secrets that are known or suspected to have been passed via CLI arguments in development, testing, or production environments **must be considered compromised and should be immediately revoked and reissued (rotated)**. This is a critical incident response measure.
3. **Clear Shell Histories**: Advise all users who may have executed the vulnerable CLI tool with real secrets to clear their respective shell history files. Provide clear, shell-specific instructions on how to do this securely (e.g., selectively removing entries or securely wiping the history file if appropriate).
4. **Audit and Sanitize Logs**: Review system logs, application logs, and CI/CD pipeline logs for any captured command-line arguments containing secrets.
    
    - If secrets are found in logs, assess the access controls on those logs.
    - If feasible and compliant with data retention policies, sanitize existing logs to remove the exposed secrets.
    - Adjust logging configurations to prevent the future capture of command-line arguments or to ensure proper scrubbing of sensitive data from logs.

**Update Documentation and Usage Examples**:

1. **Remove Insecure Instructions**: Thoroughly review and update all internal and external documentation, tutorials, README files, and usage examples to remove any instructions or code snippets that demonstrate passing secrets as CLI arguments.
2. **Document Secure Methods**: Provide clear, explicit documentation on the newly implemented, secure methods for providing secrets to the CLI tool (e.g., via environment variables, configuration files, or interactive prompts).

Implementing these fixes requires a shift in how developers approach CLI design for sensitive data. It is not merely a code fix but a change in practice, emphasizing that the convenience of CLI arguments is not suitable for the secure handling of secrets.

## **Scope and Impact**

**Scope**:

- **Affected Applications**: The vulnerability affects any Go CLI application, regardless of its complexity or purpose, if it is designed to accept sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, authentication tokens, or private keys directly as command-line arguments.
- **Platform Agnosticism**: In principle, the exposure risk is platform-agnostic. Operating systems like Linux, macOS, and Windows all provide mechanisms for users (with appropriate permissions) to view process arguments and feature shells that store command history.
- **Environmental Risk Factors**: The risk is particularly acute in:
    - **Multi-user environments**: Where multiple users share the same system, increasing the likelihood of one user observing another's process arguments or accessing their shell history if permissions are lax.
    - **Shared servers**: Common in development, testing, or even some production setups.
    - **Systems with Inadequate Process/Log Segregation**: Environments where process information or system/application logs are not strictly controlled or are aggregated to central locations with broad access.
    - **Containerized Environments**: If secrets are passed as arguments to entrypoint commands in Docker or Kubernetes, they might be visible in container inspection outputs or logs, depending on the orchestrator's configuration.

**Impact**:

The impact of this vulnerability can range from moderate to severe, directly correlating with the sensitivity of the exposed secret and the permissions it grants. Potential impacts include:

- **Confidentiality Breach**: This is the primary and most direct impactâ€”the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive credentials.
- **Account Compromise and Impersonation**: Attackers can use stolen credentials to impersonate legitimate users or services, gaining unauthorized access to their functionalities and data.
- **System Compromise**: If high-privilege credentials (e.g., root passwords, administrator API keys for cloud infrastructure) are stolen, attackers could gain partial or full control over the affected systems or even entire environments. This could lead to malware installation, backdoor creation, or further exploitation.

- **Data Breach and Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to databases, storage services, or applications via compromised credentials can lead to the theft and exfiltration of sensitive data, including customer information, financial records, or intellectual property.
- **Financial Loss**: Direct financial losses can occur through fraudulent transactions, costs associated with incident response and recovery, data breach notifications, and potential legal liabilities.
- **Reputational Damage**: Public disclosure of a secret compromise can severely damage an organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
- **Regulatory Fines and Compliance Violations**: The exposure of certain types of sensitive data (e.g., PII, PHI) can lead to non-compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, resulting in significant fines and legal action.
- **Lateral Movement and Expanded Compromise**: Even a seemingly low-privilege secret, if compromised, can provide an attacker with an initial foothold within an environment, enabling them to perform reconnaissance, discover further vulnerabilities, and move laterally to compromise more critical assets.

This vulnerability can effectively undermine other security controls. For example, strong encryption mechanisms are rendered ineffective if the encryption keys themselves are leaked via CLI arguments. Similarly, network segmentation might be bypassed if a compromised credential provides access to an internal service from an attacker-controlled point. The ease of discovery for local attackers makes this a practical threat that should not be underestimated.

## **Remediation Recommendation**

The cornerstone of remediating the `cli-args-secrets` vulnerability is to **fundamentally avoid passing secrets as command-line arguments**. Instead, Go CLI applications should be designed to ingest sensitive information through more secure channels. The choice of alternative depends on the specific use case, the operating environment, and the nature of the secret.

| **Method** | **Description** | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Go Implementation Notes (Packages/Techniques)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Interactive Prompts** | Prompt the user to enter the secret directly at runtime. The input is typically not echoed to the terminal. | Secrets are not stored in shell history or process lists. Good for user-supplied passwords. | Not suitable for automated scripts or unattended processes. Requires user interaction. | Use `golang.org/x/term` package: `password, err := term.ReadPassword(int(syscall.Stdin))`. |
| **Environment Variables** | Store secrets in environment variables, which the Go application reads at startup. | Widely supported, easy for scripts to set up. Better than CLI args for avoiding shell history. | Can be visible via `/proc/PID/environ` on Linux. Inherited by child processes by default. Requires careful management in CI/CD and container environments. | Use `os.Getenv("MY_SECRET_VAR")`. |
| **Configuration Files** | Store secrets in configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON, TOML,.env files). Access to these files must be strictly controlled via file system permissions. | Centralized configuration. Can be managed outside the application code. | Risk of insecure file permissions. Secrets might be accidentally committed to version control if not in `.gitignore`. | Libraries like `spf13/viper` or `joho/godotenv` (for `.env` files ) can be used. Ensure file permissions are restrictive (e.g., `0600`). |
| **Secrets Management Systems** | Integrate with dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager). The CLI tool authenticates to the secrets manager and fetches secrets dynamically. | Centralized, secure storage with auditing, access control, and rotation capabilities. Best practice for production services. | Adds complexity and dependency on the secrets management system. Initial authentication to the vault needs to be secure (e.g., instance roles, workload identity). | Use official Go SDKs provided by the secrets management vendor (e.g., Vault Go client, AWS SDK for Go).  |
| **OS Keychain/Keyring Services** | For user-specific secrets that need to persist on a client machine (e.g., user access tokens for a CLI), use OS-provided secure storage. | Leverages platform-native secure storage. Secrets are encrypted at rest and access-controlled by the OS. | Platform-dependent. Primarily for user-centric secrets, not typically for application/service secrets in server environments. | Libraries like `github.com/zalando/go-keyring` or `github.com/99designs/keyring` provide an abstraction layer.  |
| **Standard Input (stdin)** | Pipe secrets into the CLI tool via standard input. | Avoids process list and shell history exposure. Can be used in scripts. | Can be awkward for interactive use. Requires careful handling of input streams. The source of the piped data must be secure. | Read from `os.Stdin` using `bufio.NewReader` or `ioutil.ReadAll`. |

Beyond choosing a secure alternative for secret ingestion, the following complementary practices are recommended:

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: While not a direct fix for the exposure of arguments, always validate and sanitize any input received by the CLI (including configuration parameters that might still come from non-secret arguments) to prevent other types of vulnerabilities such as command injection or path traversal.
    
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure that any secrets used by the CLI tool, regardless of how they are obtained, grant only the minimum necessary permissions required for the tool to perform its intended functions.
- **Regular Secret Rotation**: Implement and enforce policies for the regular rotation of all secrets. This limits the window of opportunity for an attacker if a secret is compromised.
    
- **Secure Logging**: Configure logging mechanisms to ensure they do not capture or persist secrets. This includes scrubbing sensitive data from log messages and avoiding the logging of full command-line invocations if they might contain sensitive information passed through other (even secure) channels.
    
The most appropriate remediation strategy will involve a combination of these techniques, tailored to the specific requirements and operational context of the Go CLI application. The overarching goal is to move sensitive data out of the inherently insecure command-line argument channel and into a mechanism that offers better protection, access control, and auditability.

## **Summary**

The practice of passing secretsâ€”such as API keys, passwords, or authentication tokensâ€”as command-line arguments to Go CLI tools (termed `cli-args-secrets`) represents a significant security vulnerability. This method of handling sensitive information leads to its potential exposure through system process lists, shell history files, and various logging mechanisms. The core issue lies in the inherent visibility of command-line arguments within most operating system environments, a characteristic that is fundamentally incompatible with the confidentiality requirements for secrets.

The primary risks associated with this vulnerability include the unauthorized disclosure of credentials, which can subsequently lead to unauthorized access to systems and data, privilege escalation, and potentially full system compromise. The impact of such a compromise can be severe, ranging from data breaches to financial and reputational damage, depending on the nature and power of the exposed secret.

Effective remediation requires a shift in application design. Developers must cease the practice of accepting secrets via command-line arguments. Instead, Go CLI applications should adopt more secure alternatives for secret ingestion. These alternatives include, but are not limited to:

- Interactive prompts for user-supplied credentials, using packages like `golang.org/x/term` to prevent on-screen echoing.
- Reading secrets from environment variables, while acknowledging and mitigating their own potential exposure risks.
- Utilizing configuration files with strict access control permissions, managed by libraries such as `spf13/viper`.
- Integrating with dedicated secrets management systems like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider-specific solutions (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
- Leveraging OS-level keychain or keyring services for user-specific, persistent secrets.

Detecting this vulnerability involves a combination of manual code reviews, static application security testing (SAST), dynamic runtime analysis of process lists and shell history, and auditing of log files. Upon discovery, immediate action should include rotating any potentially compromised secrets and guiding users to clear their shell histories.

Developers and security teams should be educated on the risks associated with passing secrets as command-line arguments and trained in the implementation of these secure alternatives. By prioritizing secure secret handling practices, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of credential compromise stemming from their Go CLI tools.
