# Vulnerability Analysis: Incorrect Gas Estimation in Go-Ethereum Implementations

## Vulnerability Title

Incorrect Gas Estimation in Go-Ethereum's `eth_estimateGas` Leading to Transaction Failures or Excessive Cost Allocation. This is sometimes colloquially referred to as a "gas-estimation-bug."

## Severity Rating

The severity of incorrect gas estimation issues is **MediumðŸŸ¡ to HighðŸŸ  (Context-Dependent)**.
A precise CVSS score is challenging to assign universally due to the varied impact based on context. The Go security team, among others, has highlighted the limitations of CVSS in accurately reflecting the severity of vulnerabilities without considering specific usage scenarios. CISA defines severity based on CVSS base scores (Low: 0.0-3.9, Medium: 4.0-6.9, High: 7.0-10.0).

In the context of gas estimation:

- If underestimation leads to frequent transaction failures, it can cause denial of service (DoS) for specific contract interactions, impacting availability.
- If systematic underestimation is exploitable to halt critical operations or lock funds due to repeated failed transactions, the severity could be High.
- If overestimation is significant, it leads to resource consumption (excessive gas fees paid), which is a lesser, but still notable, impact.
The EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) score for a *different, unrelated* Go vulnerability (SNYK-RHEL7-GOTOOLSET119GOLANGBIN-9572475) was 0.02% (5th percentile), indicating a low probability of exploitation in the wild for that specific issue. This is mentioned for context on Go vulnerabilities but is not directly applicable to Ethereum gas estimation issues. The impact of gas estimation errors is primarily on the reliability and cost-effectiveness of blockchain interactions rather than direct compromise of underlying system integrity in the traditional sense.

## Description

The `eth_estimateGas` JSON-RPC method in Ethereum clients, including Go-Ethereum (Geth), is designed to predict the amount of gas a transaction will consume without actually executing it on the blockchain. However, this estimation can be incorrect under various circumstances, particularly when interacting with smart contracts. Incorrect gas estimation can manifest as either underestimation, leading to "out of gas" errors and transaction failures, or significant overestimation, causing users to pay unnecessarily high transaction fees. These issues stem from the complexity of predicting execution paths in smart contracts, variations in contract state, and the inherent mechanisms of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## Technical Description (for security pros)

The core of the incorrect gas estimation problem lies in the challenge of simulating transaction execution accurately in a dynamic blockchain environment. Go-Ethereum's `eth_estimateGas` typically employs a binary search algorithm to find the minimum gas required for a transaction to succeed. This search operates between a minimum gas value (e.g., 21,000 for a simple transfer) and the block gas limit.

Key technical factors contributing to inaccuracies include:

1. **State Dependency:** Smart contract execution cost can vary dramatically based on the current state of the contract and the blockchain (e.g., whether a storage slot is being written for the first time or modified). `eth_estimateGas` simulates based on the state of the *latest* or *pending* block, which might differ from the state when the transaction is actually mined.
2. **EVM's 63/64 Rule (EIP-150):** When a contract calls another contract, it can forward at most 63/64 of the remaining gas. This rule is a safeguard against reentrancy attacks depleting all gas but complicates estimation. If an inner call fails due to insufficient gas (but doesn't revert the outer call due to `try-catch` mechanisms in Solidity), `eth_estimateGas` might still consider the top-level transaction as "successful" if it doesn't revert, leading to an underestimation of the gas needed for the entire operation to complete as intended by the user.
3. **`gasleft()` Opcode:** Contracts using the `gasleft()` opcode can have execution paths that depend on the amount of gas remaining. The binary search nature of `eth_estimateGas` can interact poorly with such logic, as the behavior of the contract might change with different gas inputs during the estimation process, potentially leading the binary search to a suboptimal or incorrect estimate.
4. **"Execution Reverted" Errors:** A common issue reported by developers using `go-ethereum` is that `EstimateGas()` returns an "execution reverted" error when the `to` address is a contract, but works for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). This is often not a bug in `eth_estimateGas` itself, but rather `eth_estimateGas` correctly reporting that the transaction *would* revert if submitted with the provided parameters (e.g., invalid function arguments, unmet `require` conditions in the contract). The estimation process simulates the transaction, and if the simulation results in a revert, that's the outcome.
5. **Complex Transactions and Precompiles:** Interactions with precompiled contracts or complex sequences of internal calls can make gas prediction difficult. For instance, an issue was observed in Astar Network (using Frontier, a `go-ethereum` derivative) where the gas estimate for a function call varied significantly and incorrectly based on the content of a string parameter that seemingly had no impact on execution logic, leading to `OutOfGas` errors when the underestimated gas value was used. This suggests potential issues in how input data is decoded or handled during the gas estimation simulation for certain complex interactions or precompile calls.

The `eth_estimateGas` method in Geth attempts to provide a safe upper bound but can be capped (e.g., at 10x the current block gas limit by some providers like MetaMask to prevent abuse) or may not be sufficient if the required gas exceeds the pending block gas limit.

## Common Mistakes That Cause This

Several common practices and assumptions by developers can lead to or exacerbate problems with incorrect gas estimation:

1. **Ignoring "Execution Reverted" during Estimation:** Developers sometimes treat an "execution reverted" error from `eth_estimateGas` as a bug in the estimation function itself, rather than an indication that the transaction parameters are causing the contract to revert. The issue often lies in the transaction data, value, or sender context being invalid for the target contract function.
2. **Over-reliance on Automatic Estimation for Complex Interactions:** For transactions involving multiple contract calls, conditional logic based on `gasleft()`, or interactions with contracts whose state changes frequently, relying solely on `eth_estimateGas` without adding a buffer or implementing more sophisticated gas prediction can be risky.
3. **Not Accounting for State Changes Between Estimation and Execution:** The blockchain state can change between the time gas is estimated and the time the transaction is mined. This is particularly relevant for contracts where gas costs are sensitive to specific storage values or balances.
4. **Using Fixed Gas Limits Based on Incomplete Testing:** Hardcoding gas limits based on tests in a specific environment (e.g., a testnet or a local development node) without considering mainnet conditions or edge cases can lead to failures.
5. **Misunderstanding `try-catch` in Solidity with `eth_estimateGas`:** If a contract uses `try-catch` to handle errors in external calls, an inner call might run out of gas without reverting the top-level transaction. `eth_estimateGas` might then underestimate the gas needed for the *intended full execution path* because its binary search might settle on a gas value where the top-level call doesn't revert, even if an inner operation fails.
6. **Incorrect Transaction Parameters:** Sending transactions with incorrect data, such as malformed arguments for a contract function, or attempting operations that would violate contract logic (e.g., trying to approve from the zero address for a token transfer) will cause reverts, which `eth_estimateGas` will correctly report.
7. **Arbitrary String Lengths or Data:** For functions that take dynamic data types like strings or bytes of arbitrary length as input, the gas cost can vary significantly. If the estimation is done with a sample input that is not representative of the actual usage, the estimate can be inaccurate. This was a factor in the Astar/Frontier issue where string length affected gas estimation.

## Exploitation Goals

While "exploitation" in the traditional sense of gaining unauthorized access or executing arbitrary code is not typical for gas estimation issues, an attacker or a malicious actor might leverage these inaccuracies for other purposes:

1. **Causing Transaction Failures (Denial of Service):** If an attacker understands how a specific contract's gas consumption can be manipulated or how `eth_estimateGas` might produce an insufficient estimate for certain inputs, they could craft transactions or influence state in a way that causes legitimate users' transactions to fail due to "out of gas" errors. This is a form of localized DoS against specific contract functionalities.
2. **Increasing Operational Costs for Others:** By manipulating contract state in a way that increases the gas cost for certain operations, an attacker could make interacting with a contract more expensive for other users, although this is more related to gas cost manipulation than estimation bugs.
3. **Exploiting Miner Extractable Value (MEV):** Contracts that use `gasleft()` can be vulnerable to MEV. While not a direct exploitation of `eth_estimateGas`, incorrect estimations might interact with MEV strategies if transactions are unexpectedly reverted or delayed.
4. **Disrupting Application Logic:** If an application relies on a sequence of transactions, and some consistently fail due to gas underestimation for specific scenarios, this can disrupt the application's overall functionality or lead to inconsistent states.

The primary negative outcome is usually operational disruption or financial inefficiency rather than a direct security compromise like data theft or unauthorized control.

## Affected Components or Files

The primary affected component is the **`eth_estimateGas` JSON-RPC method** implementation within Ethereum client software, particularly **Go-Ethereum (Geth)**.
Specific areas within Geth that are involved include:

- The RPC API handling modules (`internal/ethapi/api.go` has been mentioned in older discussions regarding `eth_estimateGas` performance and logic).
- The EVM simulation logic used to predict gas consumption.
- The binary search mechanism employed for gas estimation.

While the vulnerability is in the client-side estimation, it impacts any Go application or service that relies on `go-ethereum` (either directly as a library or by connecting to a Geth node) for estimating gas for Ethereum transactions. This includes:

- Decentralized Applications (dApps) backends.
- Wallets and transaction management services.
- Blockchain explorers and analytics platforms.
- Smart contract development and deployment tools.

The issue is not confined to a single file but rather the interaction of several modules responsible for transaction simulation and RPC request handling. Derivatives of `go-ethereum`, such as Frontier used by Polkadot EVM chains, may also inherit or exhibit similar gas estimation issues.

## Vulnerable Code Snippet

A precise, universally "vulnerable" Go code snippet for `eth_estimateGas` itself is difficult to provide as the issues often stem from the interaction between the estimation logic and specific smart contract behaviors or transaction parameters. However, we can illustrate a scenario in Go where a developer might encounter problems due_ to how `eth_estimateGas` interacts with contract logic.

Consider a Go application trying to estimate gas for a contract call:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"math/big"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
)

func main() {
	// Connect to an Ethereum node
	client, err := ethclient.Dial("YOUR_ETH_NODE_URL")
	if err!= nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to connect to the Ethereum client: %v", err)
	}

	// Transaction parameters
	fromAddress := common.HexToAddress("0xSENDER_ADDRESS")
	toAddress := common.HexToAddress("0xCONTRACT_ADDRESS") // Address of the smart contract

	// Example: Calldata for a hypothetical contract function `doSomething(string memory remark)`
	// This is where issues can arise if `remark` content significantly (and unexpectedly) alters gas needs,
	// or if the contract logic for certain `remark` values would cause a revert.
	// Based on the Astar/Frontier issue [5], the length or content of such a string
	// could lead to misestimation.
	// Data for "Hello": "0x..." [5]
	// Data for "Hell": "0x..." [5]
	// For this example, let's use a placeholder for compiled calldata.
	// In a real scenario, this would be ABI-encoded function call.
	callData := common.Hex2Bytes("0xFUNCTION_SIGNATURE_AND_ENCODED_PARAMS")

	// Construct the call message
	msg := ethereum.CallMsg{
		From: fromAddress,
		To:   &toAddress,
		Data: callData,
		// Value: big.NewInt(0), // If the function is payable and requires ETH
	}

	// Estimate gas
	gasLimit, err := client.EstimateGas(context.Background(), msg)
	if err!= nil {
		// This error is crucial. If it's "execution reverted", the problem is likely
		// with the transaction parameters or contract logic, not necessarily a bug
		// in EstimateGas itself.[4]
		// However, if the estimate is returned but is too low, leading to an
		// OutOfGas error upon actual submission, that's an estimation inaccuracy.
		log.Fatalf("Failed to estimate gas: %v. This might be an 'execution reverted' error.", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Estimated gas limit: %d\n", gasLimit)

	// A common practice is to add a buffer to the estimated gas, e.g., 20-30%
	// gasLimit = uint64(float64(gasLimit) * 1.3)
	// fmt.Printf("Buffered gas limit: %d\n", gasLimit)

	// Proceed to build and send the transaction with this gasLimit...
}
```

In the context of the Arkis blog post , if the `toAddress` contract internally uses `try-catch` and `gasleft()`, the `gasLimit` returned by `client.EstimateGas` might be an underestimate. The Solidity code snippet below illustrates such a contract pattern:

```solidity
// Simplified Solidity example based on concepts from [3]
contract ComplexContract {
    address internal immutable optionalWorker;

    constructor(address _optionalWorker) {
        optionalWorker = _optionalWorker;
    }

    error OutOfGasInOptionalWork();

    function doWorkWithOptionalPart() external {
        // Main work part
        //...

        // Optional part that might consume significant gas or fail
        uint250 gasBefore = gasleft();
        try IOptionalWorker(optionalWorker).doOptionalWork() {
            // Optional work succeeded
        } catch {
            // Optional work failed. If it consumed almost all gas before failing,
            // and this catch prevents the top-level revert, eth_estimateGas might underestimate.
            // The fix suggested in [3] is to revert here if gas is critically low.
            if (gasleft() < gasBefore / 8) { // or some other threshold
                 revert OutOfGasInOptionalWork();
            }
            // Otherwise, continue without the optional work's results
        }

        // Continue with other logic
    }
}

interface IOptionalWorker {
    function doOptionalWork() external;
}
```

If `doOptionalWork()` consumes a lot of gas and fails, but `ComplexContract` catches the error and proceeds, `eth_estimateGas` might return a value sufficient for this "graceful failure" path but insufficient for the path where `doOptionalWork()` *succeeds*. This is because the binary search in `eth_estimateGas` stops when it finds a gas value that doesn't cause a top-level revert.

## Detection Steps

Detecting incorrect gas estimation vulnerabilities or issues involves a combination of monitoring, testing, and code analysis:

1. **Monitor Transaction Failures:** Track transactions that fail with "out of gas" errors. If a significant number of transactions to a specific contract or function fail this way, it may indicate an underestimation problem. Blockchain explorers like Etherscan can be used to inspect failed transactions and their gas usage.
2. **Analyze `eth_estimateGas` Behavior:**
    - When `eth_estimateGas` returns "execution reverted": Investigate the transaction parameters (sender, recipient, value, data) and the target smart contract's logic. The issue is likely that the transaction would indeed fail if submitted. Use debugging tools or local test environments to simulate the transaction with the exact parameters.
    - When `eth_estimateGas` returns a value, but transactions fail with `OutOfGas`: This points to an underestimation. This was the case in the Astar/Frontier issue.
3. **Differential Testing:** Compare gas estimates from different client implementations (e.g., Geth vs. OpenEthereum/Parity (though Parity is deprecated)) or different versions of the same client for the same transaction parameters. Significant discrepancies could indicate an issue in one of them.
4. **Fuzz Testing with Varied Inputs:** For smart contracts, especially those with functions taking dynamic inputs (e.g., strings, arrays), fuzz test the `eth_estimateGas` calls with a wide range of valid and edge-case inputs to see if estimations vary wildly or lead to failures.
5. **Static and Dynamic Analysis of Smart Contracts:**
    - Review contracts for patterns that are known to be problematic for gas estimation, such as heavy reliance on `gasleft()` in conditional logic, or complex `try-catch` blocks that might mask gas-consuming failures in sub-calls.
    - Tools like Go AST Scanner (`gas` or `gosec`) can find general security issues in Go code, but are not specifically designed for Ethereum gas estimation logic. However, custom linters or checks could be developed for Go applications that interact with `go-ethereum`.
6. **Benchmarking in Realistic Environments:** Test gas estimation and transaction success rates on a testnet that closely mirrors mainnet conditions, or use mainnet forking tools for local simulation with actual mainnet state.
7. **Leverage Advanced Simulation Tools:** Tools or upcoming features like `eth_simulateV2` aim to provide more detailed transaction simulation, including finer-grained gas estimation and stack traces, which can help diagnose issues.
8. **Community Reports and Issue Trackers:** Monitor community forums (e.g., Reddit's r/ethdev), Stack Overflow, and Ethereum client GitHub repositories (e.g., `ethereum/go-ethereum`) for reports of gas estimation problems.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

A conceptual Proof of Concept can be derived from the issue reported on the Astar Network, which uses Frontier (a `go-ethereum` derivative).

**Scenario:** Incorrect Gas Estimation Based on String Input.

1. **Target Smart Contract Function:**
A smart contract has a function `mintVNativeAsset(address receiver, string memory remark)` which is payable. The `remark` string is primarily for event logging and does not significantly alter the core logic or storage operations. Solidity
    
    ```solidity
    // Simplified contract for PoC
    contract VNativeMinter {
        event AssetMinted(address indexed receiver, uint256 value, string remark);
    
        function mintVNativeAsset(address receiver, string memory remark) external payable {
            // Core logic (e.g., minting tokens, transferring value)
            //... (assume this part has relatively constant gas cost)
    
            emit AssetMinted(receiver, msg.value, remark);
            // The remark is used in an event and potentially a sub-call (e.g., XCM transact)
        }
    }
    ```
    
2. **Interaction via `eth_estimateGas` (Conceptual Go Code):**
A Go application attempts to estimate gas for calling `mintVNativeAsset`.Go

    ```go
    // Assume 'client' is an initialized ethclient.Client
    // Assume 'contractAddress' is the deployed VNativeMinter address
    // Assume 'fromAddress' is the sender's address
    // Assume 'valueToSend' is the amount of ASTR (or native currency) to send
    
    receiverAddress := common.HexToAddress("0xSOME_RECEIVER_ADDRESS")
    
    // Case 1: remark = "Hell"
    remark1 := "Hell"
    callData1, _ := VNativeMinterABI.Pack("mintVNativeAsset", receiverAddress, remark1)
    msg1 := ethereum.CallMsg{
        From:  fromAddress,
        To:    &contractAddress,
        Value: valueToSend,
        Data:  callData1,
    }
    estimatedGas1, err1 := client.EstimateGas(context.Background(), msg1)
    // According to [5], this yielded ~180k gas.
    
    // Case 2: remark = "Hello"
    remark2 := "Hello"
    callData2, _ := VNativeMinterABI.Pack("mintVNativeAsset", receiverAddress, remark2)
    msg2 := ethereum.CallMsg{
        From:  fromAddress,
        To:    &contractAddress,
        Value: valueToSend,
        Data:  callData2,
    }
    estimatedGas2, err2 := client.EstimateGas(context.Background(), msg2)
    // According to [5], this yielded ~167k gas.
    ```
    
3. **Observed Behavior :**
    - For `remark = "Hell"`, `eth_estimateGas` returned approximately 180,000 gas. Transactions submitted with this estimate likely succeeded or were closer to the actual required gas.
    - For `remark = "Hello"` (simply adding an 'o'), `eth_estimateGas` returned approximately 167,000 gas. This was a significant drop.
    - When a transaction was submitted with the `estimatedGas2` value (167k for "Hello"), it failed with an `OutOfGas` error.
4. **Conclusion of PoC:**
This demonstrates a scenario where a minor, seemingly inconsequential change in a string input parameter led to a significant underestimation of gas by the `eth_estimateGas` method in a `go-ethereum` based client. The estimation logic failed to correctly account for the gas impact of processing the slightly longer string, possibly within event emission, data encoding for sub-calls, or other internal operations triggered by the `remark` parameter. This forced users to manually adjust gas limits or face transaction failures. The underlying cause was hypothesized to be incorrect decoding of input data leading to the reduced estimate.

This PoC highlights that `eth_estimateGas` is not infallible and can be sensitive to input data in ways that are not immediately obvious from the high-level contract logic.

## Risk Classification

The "Incorrect Gas Estimation" vulnerability aligns with **CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation**.

- **Description of CWE-682:** The product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management. In this case, the "incorrect calculation" is the gas estimation, and the "resource management" is the allocation of gas (and thereby funds) for a transaction.

**Common Consequences of CWE-682 applicable to Incorrect Gas Estimation:**

| Consequence Category | Scope (Security Area Violated) | Details Related to Gas Estimation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart** | Availability | If underestimation of gas leads to transaction failure ("out of gas"), it effectively denies the service or functionality intended by that transaction. Repeated failures can disrupt application workflows. |
| **DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)** | Availability, Integrity | Significant overestimation of gas leads to users paying more than necessary for transactions, consuming their financial resources (ETH for gas fees) inefficiently. |
| **Bypass Protection Mechanism (Indirectly)** | Access Control (Potentially) | While not a direct bypass, if a critical security operation (e.g., an emergency pause of a contract) fails due to incorrect gas estimation, it could prevent a protective action from being timely executed. |
| **Reduced Reliability / Unpredictability** | Integrity, Availability | The system becomes less reliable as users cannot consistently predict transaction success or cost, undermining trust and usability of the blockchain application. |

The primary risks are related to **Availability** (transactions failing) and **Integrity** (users overpaying or application state becoming inconsistent due to partial successes/failures if not handled carefully). Confidentiality is generally not directly impacted by gas estimation errors. The likelihood of exploitation for malicious DoS depends on the predictability and manipulability of the gas underestimation for specific contracts.

## Fix & Patch Guidance

Addressing incorrect gas estimation requires a multi-faceted approach, involving improvements in Ethereum clients, developer best practices, and potentially new Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).

1. **Client-Level Improvements (e.g., in Go-Ethereum):**
    - **Refine Binary Search Logic:** For issues like the one described in the Arkis blog , where `try-catch` in Solidity might mislead the binary search, client estimation logic could be enhanced. One suggestion is to make the estimation more sensitive to significant gas consumption in sub-calls even if the top-level call doesn't revert, or by allowing contracts to signal "near out of gas" conditions more explicitly.
    - **Improved Simulation Accuracy:** Continuously improve the accuracy of the EVM simulation within `eth_estimateGas` to better reflect actual execution costs, especially for edge cases involving precompiles or complex data types as seen in the Astar/Frontier issue.
    - **Adopt `eth_simulateV2`:** This proposed RPC method aims to provide more detailed simulation results, including better gas estimations, stack traces, and the ability to test against "phantom blocks" (simulated future states). Wider adoption and integration of such tools into Geth would be beneficial.
    - **Regular Patching:** The Go-Ethereum team sometimes silently patches vulnerabilities, including DoS vectors related to block processing or networking, and discloses them later. Users should keep their Geth nodes updated.
2. **Developer Best Practices:**
    - **Add a Buffer:** When using `eth_estimateGas`, programmatically add a safety margin (e.g., 20-30%) to the estimated gas limit, especially for critical transactions or those interacting with complex contracts. MetaMask and other wallets often do this automatically. Example: `gasLimit = estimatedGas * 1.2` or `gasLimit = estimatedGas + 20000`.
    - **Manual Gas Limits for Known Interactions:** For frequently executed, critical transactions with predictable gas costs, developers might consider using a well-tested, manually set gas limit instead of relying on `eth_estimateGas` every time.
    - **Robust Error Handling:** In applications, handle potential "out of gas" errors gracefully, perhaps by allowing users to retry with a higher gas limit.
    - **Thorough Testing:** Test contract interactions under various conditions and input data on testnets or using mainnet forking to identify potential gas estimation issues.
    - **Understand Contract Reverts:** If `eth_estimateGas` returns "execution reverted," debug the transaction parameters and contract logic thoroughly. The issue is often that the transaction *should* revert.
3. **Smart Contract Design Considerations:**
    - **Avoid Overly Complex `gasleft()` Logic:** While `gasleft()` can be useful, intricate logic based on it can make gas estimation very difficult and potentially lead to vulnerabilities.
    - **Provide Gas-Efficient Alternatives:** If a function can have vastly different gas costs, consider if alternative, more predictable functions can be offered for common use cases.
4. **Network-Level Proposals:**
    - **Block-Level Warming:** Proposals like Block-Level Warming aim to optimize storage access costs by treating storage slots as "warm" throughout a block if accessed multiple times, which could reduce gas costs and potentially simplify some aspects of estimation.
    - **Combined Estimation and Execution:** Integrating gas estimation and transaction execution into a single operation is another area of research to improve accuracy and reduce latency.

For specific bugs identified in `go-ethereum` or its derivatives (like the Frontier issue ), patches would involve fixing the specific part of the simulation or input decoding logic that leads to the incorrect estimate. The Frontier issue was reportedly fixed by patches #1239 and #1257 in the Frontier repository, suggesting targeted code changes to address the miscalculation.

## Scope and Impact

The scope of incorrect gas estimation vulnerabilities extends to any user, developer, or application interacting with the Ethereum network (or other EVM-compatible chains) through affected clients like Go-Ethereum.

**Impacts include:**

1. **User Experience Degradation:**
    - **Transaction Failures:** Frequent "out of gas" errors lead to frustration, wasted time, and potentially lost opportunities (e.g., in time-sensitive DeFi operations or NFT mints). Users may need to manually increase gas limits, which can be confusing for non-technical individuals.
    - **Overpayment:** Consistent overestimation or users manually setting excessively high gas limits to avoid failures leads to higher transaction costs than necessary.
2. **Application Reliability Issues:**
    - **DApp Instability:** Applications that rely on automated gas estimation may become unreliable if estimates are frequently incorrect, leading to failed interactions with their smart contracts.
    - **Inconsistent State:** If a sequence of operations is expected, and some fail due to gas issues, it could lead to an inconsistent application state if not handled robustly.
3. **Economic Consequences:**
    - **Wasted Gas Fees:** Failed transactions still consume gas up to the limit provided, meaning users lose the ETH paid for gas without achieving their intended action.
    - **Increased Development and Support Costs:** Developers spend more time debugging gas-related issues, and support teams handle user complaints about failed transactions.
4. **Network Perception and Trust:**
    - While not directly a network security threat like a consensus bug, persistent gas estimation problems can make the network appear less reliable or more expensive than it is, potentially hindering adoption.
5. **Specific Vulnerability Instances:**
    - In the Astar/Frontier case, the incorrect estimation for specific string inputs directly led to `OutOfGas` errors for users attempting to use the affected `mintVNativeAsset` function with those inputs.
    - The pitfalls of `eth_estimateGas` with `gasleft()` and `try-catch` can lead to contracts that seem to work during estimation but fail subtly in certain execution paths at runtime, potentially locking contract processes if not enough gas is provided for the *intended successful* path.

The overall impact is a reduction in the efficiency, reliability, and user-friendliness of interacting with blockchain applications. While generally not leading to direct theft of funds from wallets (unless a contract bug is also involved), the cumulative effect of wasted gas and failed transactions can be economically significant for users and platforms.

## Remediation Recommendation

Addressing and mitigating the risks of incorrect gas estimation requires proactive measures from both Ethereum client developers (like the Go-Ethereum team) and application developers building on Ethereum.

1. **For Go-Ethereum Developers and Maintainers:**
    - **Prioritize Robust Simulation:** Continue to invest in improving the accuracy of the EVM simulation engine within `eth_estimateGas`, paying special attention to edge cases involving precompiled contracts, dynamic data types, and complex EVM mechanics like the 63/64 rule and `gasleft()` interactions.
    - **Investigate and Patch Specific Bugs:** Actively investigate reported anomalies in gas estimation, such as those seen in the Astar/Frontier issue, and implement targeted patches.
    - **Advance and Adopt Enhanced Estimation APIs:** Support and integrate more advanced estimation mechanisms like `eth_simulateV2` that offer greater insight and accuracy.
    - **Clearer Error Reporting:** Ensure that errors returned by `eth_estimateGas` (e.g., "execution reverted") are clearly distinguishable from actual estimation failures, and provide as much context as possible to help developers diagnose the root cause.
2. **For Application Developers Using Go-Ethereum (or any Ethereum client):**
    - **Implement Gas Buffering:** As a standard practice, add a percentage-based buffer (e.g., 20-50%) or a fixed buffer to the gas limit returned by `eth_estimateGas`, especially for transactions involving contract interactions. The optimal buffer may vary by network and contract complexity.
        
        ```go
        // Example in Go
        estimatedGas, err := client.EstimateGas(context.Background(), msg)
        if err!= nil { /* handle error */ }
        // Add a 30% buffer
        finalGasLimit := uint64(float64(estimatedGas) * 1.3)
        ```
        
    - **Thoroughly Test Gas Requirements:** Do not rely solely on `eth_estimateGas`. Conduct extensive testing of transactions on testnets and using mainnet forking tools (e.g., Hardhat, Foundry) to understand actual gas consumption under various scenarios and states.
    - **Monitor and Analyze Failed Transactions:** Implement monitoring to capture transactions that fail due to "out of gas" errors. Analyze these failures to identify patterns or specific contract interactions that are prone to underestimation.
    - **Provide User-Friendly Fallbacks:** If a transaction fails due to an out-of-gas error, provide clear feedback to the user and suggest retrying with a manually increased gas limit or using a "high gas" option.
    - **Stay Updated:** Keep Go-Ethereum client libraries and nodes updated to benefit from the latest patches and improvements.
    - **Educate Users (If Applicable):** For applications with direct user interaction for transactions, provide guidance on gas fees and the possibility of estimation inaccuracies.
    - **Consider Gas Optimization in Smart Contracts:** While not a direct fix for client estimation bugs, writing gas-efficient smart contracts can reduce the overall gas needed and potentially simplify estimation. For example, minimize storage access within loops by loading data into memory.
    - **Use Gas Estimator Tools/Libraries:** Explore specialized gas estimation libraries or services that may offer more sophisticated heuristics than the default `eth_estimateGas`, or use historical fee data to inform estimates.
3. **For End Users:**
    - **Use Reputable Wallets:** Modern wallets often have improved gas estimation features and may automatically add buffers or allow users to choose between different fee levels (e.g., slow, average, fast) which implicitly adjust gas price and sometimes limits.
    - **Be Cautious with Manual Gas Limits:** If manually setting gas limits, understand the risk of transaction failure if set too low. It can be helpful to check recent successful transactions for similar contract interactions on a block explorer to get an idea of typical gas usage.

By combining client-side improvements with diligent application-level practices, the impact of incorrect gas estimation can be significantly mitigated.

## Summary

Incorrect gas estimation in Go-Ethereum's `eth_estimateGas` method, and more broadly in Ethereum clients, presents a persistent challenge for developers and users. This issue, classified under CWE-682 (Incorrect Calculation), arises from the complexities of simulating EVM execution, state dependencies, and specific EVM rules like the 63/64 gas forwarding limit. Problems manifest as "execution reverted" errors (often indicating issues with transaction parameters rather than the estimator itself ) or, more critically, as underestimations leading to "out of gas" transaction failures , or overestimations causing excessive fee payments.

Notable instances, such as the input-dependent estimation errors observed in the Astar/Frontier case  and the subtle underestimations possible with `gasleft()` and `try-catch` patterns in Solidity , underscore the nuanced nature of this problem. The impact ranges from degraded user experience and wasted gas fees to unreliable application behavior and localized denial of service.

Mitigation strategies involve continuous refinement of client-side estimation logic by Go-Ethereum maintainers, including potential adoption of advanced simulation tools like `eth_simulateV2`. For application developers, best practices include adding buffers to estimated gas limits, thorough testing across various scenarios, robust error handling for transaction failures, and careful debugging of "execution reverted" messages from `eth_estimateGas`. While a perfect, universally accurate gas estimation remains elusive due to the Turing-complete nature of the EVM and dynamic state changes, a combination of client improvements and diligent developer practices can significantly reduce the frequency and impact of these estimation issues.
