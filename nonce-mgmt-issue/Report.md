## Vulnerability Title

Incorrect Nonce Management (Nonce Reuse)

*Note: The term "max-round-logic-bug" does not correspond to a standard or recognized vulnerability name in the context of Golang or general cryptography. The issue is correctly identified as "Incorrect Nonce Management" or more specifically, "Nonce Reuse."*

### Severity Rating

**CriticalðŸ”´**

When a nonce is reused with the same key in certain cryptographic algorithms, it can lead to a complete compromise of the confidentiality and integrity of the encrypted data, and in some cases, the recovery of the private key.

### Description

A nonce (number used once) is a value used in cryptographic communications to ensure that each message is unique, even when sent with the same encryption key. This vulnerability occurs when an application reuses a nonce for multiple encryption operations with the same key. Authenticated encryption algorithms like AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode) rely on the absolute uniqueness of the (key, nonce) pair for security. Reusing a nonce catastrophically breaks this security guarantee.

### Technical Description (for security pros)

In stream ciphers and AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) modes like AES-GCM, a keystream is generated from the key and nonce. This keystream is then XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. If the same key and nonce are used to encrypt two different plaintexts ($P_1$ and $P_2$), the same keystream ($K_s$) is generated. An attacker who obtains the two resulting ciphertexts ($C_1$ and $C_2$) can XOR them together ($C_1 \oplus C_2$), which cancels out the keystream ($(P_1 \oplus K_s) \oplus (P_2 \oplus K_s) = P_1 \oplus P_2$). This reveals the XOR of the two plaintexts, from which an attacker can often deduce the original messages. Furthermore, for AES-GCM, nonce reuse allows an attacker to recover the authentication key (GHASH key), enabling them to forge messages. In the context of digital signature algorithms like ECDSA, reusing a nonce across two different signatures allows for the complete recovery of the private key.

### Common Mistakes That Cause This

* **Hardcoding a nonce:** Using a fixed, constant value for the nonce in the code.
* **Using a non-random or predictable source:** Generating nonces from weak sources like `math/rand` instead of the cryptographically secure `crypto/rand`.
* **Stateful counter issues:** Implementing a counter-based nonce system that fails to persist its state correctly across application restarts, causing the counter to reset.
* **Concurrency bugs:** In a multi-threaded application, different threads might generate the same nonce value if the generation mechanism is not properly synchronized.

### Exploitation Goals

* **Decrypt confidential information:** By obtaining two ciphertexts encrypted with the same key and nonce, an attacker can compromise their confidentiality.
* **Forge valid messages:** In AEAD schemes like AES-GCM, an attacker can learn the authentication key, allowing them to create and pass off forged ciphertexts as authentic.
* **Recover the private key:** For signature schemes like ECDSA, nonce reuse allows a complete compromise of the signing key, enabling the attacker to forge any signature.

### Affected Components or Files

This vulnerability primarily affects code that uses Go's standard cryptography libraries for symmetric and asymmetric operations.

* **`crypto/cipher`:** Specifically, functions creating new AEAD ciphers like `cipher.NewGCM`. The `Seal` and `Open` methods are where the nonce is used.
* **`crypto/ecdsa`:** The `Sign` function, if a custom `rand.Reader` is provided that produces duplicate values.

### Vulnerable Code Snippet

This snippet demonstrates the critical mistake of using a hardcoded, reused nonce for AES-GCM encryption.

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/aes"
	"crypto/cipher"
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	// Key should be 32 bytes for AES-256. NEVER hardcode keys in production.
	key := []byte("a very secret key 12345678901234")
	plaintext1 := []byte("This is the first secret message.")
	plaintext2 := []byte("This is the second, different one.")

	block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	gcm, err := cipher.NewGCM(block)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// DANGEROUS: Using a hardcoded, reused nonce.
	// Nonce size for GCM is typically 12 bytes.
	nonce := []byte("bad-nonce123")

	ciphertext1 := gcm.Seal(nil, nonce, plaintext1, nil)
	fmt.Printf("Ciphertext 1: %x\n", ciphertext1)

	// The same nonce is used again for a different message.
	ciphertext2 := gcm.Seal(nil, nonce, plaintext2, nil)
	fmt.Printf("Ciphertext 2: %x\n", ciphertext2)

	// An attacker with access to ciphertext1 and ciphertext2 can now compromise the plaintexts.
}
```

### Detection Steps

1.  **Static Analysis:** Use a security scanner like `gosec`, which has specific rules (e.g., G407) to detect the use of hardcoded nonces or IVs (Initialization Vectors).
2.  **Manual Code Review:** Inspect all cryptographic code, particularly focusing on how nonces are generated and passed to functions like `gcm.Seal`. Look for hardcoded values, predictable sequences, or the use of non-cryptographic random number generators.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis:** In a controlled test environment, monitor the nonce values used in multiple encryption calls. If the same nonce is observed for the same key, the application is vulnerable.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

An attacker who has captured the two ciphertexts from the vulnerable code above can recover the XOR of the plaintexts.

```go
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// Attacker has captured these two ciphertexts
	ciphertext1 := []byte{ /* ... bytes from vulnerable code output ... */ }
	ciphertext2 := []byte{ /* ... bytes from vulnerable code output ... */ }

	// The expected plaintexts (for demonstration)
	plaintext1 := []byte("This is the first secret message.")
	plaintext2 := []byte("This is the second, different one.")

	// XOR the two ciphertexts
	xorResult := make([]byte, len(ciphertext1))
	for i := range ciphertext1 {
		xorResult[i] = ciphertext1[i] ^ ciphertext2[i]
	}

	// Calculate the XOR of the original plaintexts
	expectedXor := make([]byte, len(plaintext1))
	for i := range plaintext1 {
		expectedXor[i] = plaintext1[i] ^ plaintext2[i]
	}

	// Verify that the XOR of the ciphertexts equals the XOR of the plaintexts
	// This proves the keystream was cancelled out.
	if bytes.Equal(xorResult, expectedXor) {
		fmt.Println("Success! The XOR of the plaintexts has been recovered.")
		fmt.Printf("Recovered XOR: %x\n", xorResult)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Failed to recover plaintext XOR.")
	}
}
```

### Risk Classification

* **CWE-329:** Not Using a Random IV with CBC Mode (similar principle applies to nonce in GCM)
* **CWE-327:** Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (The algorithm is not broken, but its misuse renders it so)


### Fix & Patch Guidance

The fix is to ensure that a unique, cryptographically random nonce is generated for every single encryption operation performed with a given key. Use Go's `crypto/rand` package for this purpose.

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/aes"
	"crypto/cipher"
	"crypto/rand"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	key := []byte("a very secret key 12345678901234") // NEVER hardcode keys
	plaintext := []byte("This is a secret message.")

	block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	gcm, err := cipher.NewGCM(block)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Create a new, random nonce for this encryption
	nonce := make([]byte, gcm.NonceSize())
	if _, err := io.ReadFull(rand.Reader, nonce); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Prepend the nonce to the ciphertext. This is a common practice.
	ciphertext := gcm.Seal(nonce, nonce, plaintext, nil)

	fmt.Printf("Ciphertext (nonce prepended): %x\n", ciphertext)
}
```

### Scope and Impact

The scope of this vulnerability is any part of the application that performs encryption. The impact is a total loss of confidentiality for all data encrypted with a reused nonce. For authenticated encryption, it also leads to a loss of integrity, allowing an attacker to forge messages. For digital signatures, it leads to a total compromise of the signing key. This can result in severe data breaches, financial fraud, and complete system compromise.


### Remediation Recommendation

* **Always use `crypto/rand` to generate nonces** for encryption algorithms like AES-GCM.
* **The nonce must be unique for every message encrypted with the same key.** The best practice is to generate a new, random nonce every time.
* **Never hardcode nonces, IVs, or keys** in your source code. Use a secure mechanism for managing secrets.
* **For AEAD schemes, a common and safe pattern is to generate a random nonce and prepend it to the ciphertext.** The recipient can then read the nonce from the beginning of the message to use for decryption.


### Summary

Incorrect nonce management, specifically nonce reuse, is a critical cryptographic vulnerability in Golang applications. It stems from using the same nonce to encrypt multiple messages with the same key, which completely undermines the security guarantees of modern ciphers like AES-GCM and signature schemes like ECDSA. Developers must ensure that a unique, cryptographically secure nonce is generated for every single encryption or signing operation. The standard `crypto/rand` package in Go provides the necessary tools to implement this correctly and avoid catastrophic security failures.
