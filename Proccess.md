## 🔍 Step 1: Detection – “Something Feels Off”
Ask yourself:
- ❓ Is the app crashing, panicking, or behaving weirdly?
- 🧪 Did you try fuzzing / random inputs and get crashes?
- 📊 Are there unexplained performance drops, gas drains, or memory spikes?
- 💬 Did someone report a bug, or did a security tool flag something?

📦 Tools that help:
- `gosec` (static code scanner)
- `golangci-lint` (multi-linter, includes security checks)
- Manual code review
- Fuzz testing (`go test -fuzz`)
- Logging and observability

---

## 🧠 Step 2: Understand the Vulnerability
Ask:
- 🧬 What part of the system is affected? (auth, crypto, RPC, DB?)
- 🧨 What *could* happen if this vuln is exploited?
  - Denial of service?
  - Key leakage?
  - Invalid transactions?
  - Arbitrary execution?

> Example: You’re using `math/rand` instead of `crypto/rand` for private key generation.  
> 🔥 Result: Anyone can guess keys — complete compromise!

---

## 🔎 Step 3: Reproduce It
- Isolate the vuln into a small `.go` file (your example repo is perfect for this).
- Show:
  - The **bad version** that causes the issue.
  - Optionally, how it might be exploited.

💡 This is great content for `go-vulnerabilities`.

---

## 🛠️ Step 4: Solve It (and Learn Why)
- Fix the code using **secure best practices**.
- Document *why* the fix works:
  - Using `constant-time` comparison for hashes.
  - Verifying input length and type.
  - Protecting concurrent access with mutexes.
  - Validating JSON input with strict structs.

📘 Example:  
Bad:
```go
if inputPassword == dbPassword {
    // login
}
```
✅ Good:
```go
import "crypto/subtle"
if subtle.ConstantTimeCompare([]byte(inputPassword), []byte(dbPassword)) == 1 {
    // login
}
```

---

## 🧰 Step 5: Add a Test
- Prove that the vulnerability is now gone.
- Show what used to fail (or be exploitable), now passes securely.

---

## 📖 Step 6: Document It
In your repo:
- `README.md`: What this vuln is, how to reproduce, how to fix.
- `file.go`: Minimal reproducible + fixed example.
- Tag it: `auth`, `crypto`, `panic`, `rpc`, `race`, etc.

---

### 🧠 Bonus: Adopt a Secure Dev Mindset
Always ask:
- 🛡️ **What is the threat model?**
- 🔐 **What secrets or state could be attacked?**
- 🪤 **What could an attacker send to crash or exploit this?**
- 🧪 **Can I test for this automatically next time?**

Would you like me to scaffold your first vulnerability example in the repo? Like:
- Folder: `/crypto/weak_random_key/`
- Files: `vuln.go`, `README.md`
