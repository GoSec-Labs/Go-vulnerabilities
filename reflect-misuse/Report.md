## Vulnerability Title

Misuse of `reflect` package (reflect-misuse)

### Severity Rating

**Medium to Critical** (CVSS 3.x Score 4.0-9.8, highly dependent on context and controllable inputs). A severe misuse can lead to RCE.

### Description

The `reflect` package in Go provides powerful capabilities for runtime introspection and manipulation of types and values. However, its misuse, particularly when coupled with untrusted user input, can lead to serious security vulnerabilities such as data tampering, bypassing access controls, and potentially remote code execution (RCE). The core problem arises when reflection operations like `reflect.ValueOf().Set()` or `reflect.ValueOf().Call()` are used on fields or methods whose names or values are derived directly or indirectly from user-controlled data without sufficient validation.

### Technical Description (for security pros)

The `reflect` package allows a Go program to inspect and modify its own structure at runtime. Key functions and methods include:

  * `reflect.ValueOf()`: Returns a `reflect.Value` for a given `interface{}`.
  * `reflect.Type()`: Returns a `reflect.Type` for a given `interface{}`.
  * `Value.FieldByName()`, `Value.MethodByName()`: Access fields or methods by name.
  * `Value.Set*()` methods (`SetInt`, `SetString`, `SetBool`, etc.): Modify the underlying value of a `reflect.Value` if it is "settable."
  * `Value.Call()`: Invokes a method on a `reflect.Value`.
  * `Value.CanSet()`: Checks if a `reflect.Value` is settable (i.e., addressable and exported).

The vulnerability occurs when an attacker can control the name of a field, method, or the value being set, which is then passed to a reflection function. This can enable:

  * **Arbitrary Field Modification:** An attacker supplies a field name (e.g., `IsAdmin`, `Price`) and a new value, bypassing application logic or validation. This is possible if `Value.CanSet()` returns true and `reflect.ValueOf().Set()` is used without proper checks.
  * **Arbitrary Method Invocation:** An attacker supplies a method name, potentially including methods that were not intended to be exposed (e.g., internal utility functions, administrative actions), and arguments for that method.
  * **Type Confusion/Bypass:** Reflection can be used to bypass Go's static type safety checks, leading to unexpected behavior or injection if type conversions are not carefully handled.
  * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In extreme cases, if the application dynamically loads modules or executes commands based on reflected values, an attacker might be able to inject and execute arbitrary code. This typically involves combining `reflect` misuse with other vulnerabilities or design flaws.

### Common Mistakes That Cause This

  * **Unvalidated User Input:** Directly using user-provided strings (from URLs, JSON, form data) as field names or method names for reflection operations without a whitelist or strict validation.
  * **Generic Data Binding/Mapping:** Implementing generic data binding or object-relational mapping (ORM) logic that uses reflection to populate struct fields from untrusted input, without proper validation on which fields are allowed to be set.
  * **Dynamic API Endpoints:** Designing API endpoints that dynamically call methods on objects based on an endpoint path or request parameter, relying solely on reflection for dispatch.
  * **Over-Permissive Reflection:** Using `reflect.Value.Set()` or `reflect.Value.Call()` without sufficiently checking `CanSet()` or `CanCall()`, or failing to verify the `Kind()` or `Type()` of the reflected value/method.
  * **Bypassing Exported Fields/Methods:** While Go's reflection prevents direct modification of unexported fields (`CanSet()` will be false) and direct invocation of unexported methods (`MethodByName()` won't find them), indirect manipulation might still be possible if a settable exported field holds a pointer to an unexported struct, or if an exported method exposes unsafe operations that can be leveraged.

### Exploitation Goals

  * **Privilege Escalation:** Modifying a `User` struct's `IsAdmin` field from `false` to `true`.
  * **Data Tampering:** Changing prices in an e-commerce application, altering transaction details, or modifying other critical business data.
  * **Access Control Bypass:** Invoking internal methods that bypass authentication or authorization checks.
  * **Information Disclosure:** Reading sensitive but accessible fields through reflection (though `reflect.Value.CanSet()` is the primary concern for modification, `reflect.Value.Interface()` can read).
  * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Injecting and executing arbitrary code, typically by chaining with other vulnerabilities.

### Affected Components or Files

  * Any Go source file (`.go`) that imports `reflect` and uses its capabilities to dynamically interact with data structures or methods, especially where user input influences the reflection path.
  * Configuration files that define dynamic mappings or reflection-based behaviors.

### Vulnerable Code Snippet

Consider a web application that takes user input to update a profile:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"reflect"
	"strconv"
)

type UserProfile struct {
	ID        int
	Username  string
	Email     string
	IsAdmin   bool // Sensitive field
	Password  string // Sensitive field
	// ... other fields
}

func updateProfile(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	if r.Method != http.MethodPost {
		http.Error(w, "Method not allowed", http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)
		return
	}

	// Imagine a user profile retrieved from a database based on session
	user := &UserProfile{
		ID:       123,
		Username: "alice",
		Email:    "alice@example.com",
		IsAdmin:  false,
		Password: "hashed_password",
	}

	// VULNERABLE CODE: Directly using user input to set fields via reflection
	// An attacker can send: /updateProfile?field=IsAdmin&value=true
	// Or: /updateProfile?field=Password&value=new_cleartext_password
	fieldName := r.URL.Query().Get("field")
	fieldValue := r.URL.Query().Get("value")

	if fieldName == "" {
		http.Error(w, "Field name cannot be empty", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	// Get reflect.Value of the pointer to the struct, then Elem() to get the struct value
	userValue := reflect.ValueOf(user).Elem()
	field := userValue.FieldByName(fieldName)

	if !field.IsValid() {
		http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Field '%s' not found", fieldName), http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	if !field.CanSet() {
		// This check helps, but if 'fieldName' is an exported field, it will pass.
		http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Field '%s' cannot be set", fieldName), http.StatusForbidden)
		return
	}

	// Attempt to set the value based on its kind
	switch field.Kind() {
	case reflect.String:
		field.SetString(fieldValue)
	case reflect.Bool:
		boolVal, err := strconv.ParseBool(fieldValue)
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, "Invalid boolean value", http.StatusBadRequest)
			return
		}
		field.SetBool(boolVal)
	case reflect.Int, reflect.Int8, reflect.Int16, reflect.Int32, reflect.Int64:
		intVal, err := strconv.ParseInt(fieldValue, 10, 64)
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, "Invalid integer value", http.StatusBadRequest)
			return
		}
		field.SetInt(intVal)
	// ... handle other types
	default:
		http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Unsupported field type for '%s'", fieldName), http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Profile updated for %s. New IsAdmin status: %t\n", user.Username, user.IsAdmin)
	// In a real app, 'user' would then be saved back to the database.
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/updateProfile", updateProfile)
	fmt.Println("Server listening on :8080")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

**Exploitation Example:**
An attacker sends a request like:
`POST /updateProfile?field=IsAdmin&value=true`

This would bypass any logical checks that might have been in place to prevent a regular user from becoming an admin, as the reflection code directly modifies the `IsAdmin` field.

### Detection Steps

1.  **Code Review:** Manually inspect code for usages of the `reflect` package, specifically `reflect.ValueOf().FieldByName()`, `reflect.ValueOf().MethodByName()`, and any of the `Set*()` or `Call()` methods. Pay close attention to where the names of fields or methods, or the values being set, originate from user input.
2.  **Static Analysis (SAST):** Use SAST tools capable of tracking data flow from untrusted sources to reflection sinks. While challenging for reflection, some advanced tools may detect patterns of misuse.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (DAST) / Fuzzing:** Fuzzing web application parameters with common field names (e.g., `IsAdmin`, `Role`, `Password`, `DebugMode`) and unexpected values can reveal if reflection is being used insecurely.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

(Using the vulnerable code snippet above)

**Objective:** Change a non-admin user to an admin.

1.  **Start the vulnerable server:**

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

2.  **Send the malicious request:**

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/updateProfile?field=IsAdmin&value=true"
    ```

3.  **Observe the response:**
    The server would respond with something like:
    `Profile updated for alice. New IsAdmin status: true`

    This demonstrates that the `IsAdmin` field was directly modified, bypassing any intended authorization logic.

### Risk Classification

  * **Confidentiality:** Medium (sensitive data exposure if fields can be read, or if RCE allows file exfiltration).
  * **Integrity:** High (direct manipulation of sensitive application state/data).
  * **Availability:** Low to Medium (depending on what can be modified; can lead to DoS if critical state is corrupted).
  * **Accountability:** Low (hard to trace the exact source of a reflection-based attack unless detailed logs are present).
  * **Overall Impact:** Can range from moderate data integrity issues to critical RCE, depending on the application's design and the sensitive fields/methods accessible via reflection.

### Fix & Patch Guidance

The primary mitigation is to avoid using reflection with untrusted user input unless absolutely necessary and, even then, only with strict validation.

1.  **Whitelist Approach:** Instead of allowing any field/method name, maintain a strict whitelist of properties that are allowed to be modified or invoked by user input.
    ```go
    // Safe approach: Only allow specific, non-sensitive fields to be set by user
    allowedFields := map[string]bool{
        "Email": true,
        "Username": true,
        // Do NOT include "IsAdmin", "Password", etc.
    }

    if !allowedFields[fieldName] {
        http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Field '%s' is not allowed to be updated", fieldName), http.StatusForbidden)
        return
    }

    // ... proceed with reflection as before, but only for whitelisted fields
    ```
2.  **Manual Field Setting:** For sensitive fields, explicitly set them in your code rather than relying on dynamic reflection. This makes the data flow explicit and easier to secure.
    ```go
    // Preferred approach: Explicitly handle allowed fields
    if fieldName == "Email" {
        user.Email = fieldValue
    } else if fieldName == "Username" {
        user.Username = fieldValue
    } else {
        http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Field '%s' is not allowed to be updated", fieldName), http.StatusForbidden)
        return
    }
    ```
3.  **Strict Validation:** If reflection is indispensable, implement comprehensive validation on the `reflect.Value` (using `Kind()`, `Type()`, `CanSet()`, `CanCall()`) *before* attempting to set or call. Ensure the `reflect.Value` itself is not a pointer to something sensitive or doesn't allow access to unexported fields through indirect means (which `CanSet()` usually prevents directly, but careful review is still needed).
4.  **Least Privilege:** Design your application with the principle of least privilege. If a component uses reflection, ensure it only has access to the minimal set of types and operations it requires.
5.  **Separate API for Sensitive Actions:** For actions like changing `IsAdmin` status, create distinct, authenticated API endpoints with explicit authorization checks, rather than relying on a generic reflection-based update mechanism.

### Scope and Impact

The scope of impact depends heavily on:

  * **Application Design:** How extensively and generically reflection is used with user-controlled input.
  * **Sensitive Data/Logic:** What sensitive fields or critical methods are accessible via reflection.
  * **Trust Boundaries:** Whether reflection is used within internal services where input is already trusted, or directly exposed to external, untrusted input.

A widespread misuse can allow an attacker to completely control an application's state, escalate privileges, and potentially execute arbitrary code.

### Remediation Recommendation

Prioritize refactoring any code that uses the `reflect` package to directly modify object properties or invoke methods based on unvalidated user input. Implement a strong whitelist of allowed fields/methods for dynamic updates. For sensitive operations, always use explicit, type-safe setters and dedicated API endpoints with proper authorization. Regularly audit code for `reflect` package usage in security-sensitive contexts.

### Summary

Misusing Go's `reflect` package by allowing untrusted user input to control field names, method names, or values set via reflection can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, including data tampering, privilege escalation, and even remote code execution. This is often caused by generic data binding or dynamic dispatch mechanisms without proper validation. The most effective remediation involves implementing strict whitelists for dynamically settable properties and handling sensitive operations through explicit, type-safe code paths rather than relying on broad reflection.
