# **Golang Vulnerabilities: The JWT "None" Algorithm**

## **I. The JWT "None" Algorithm Vulnerability: An Overview**

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) have become a ubiquitous standard for securely transmitting information between parties as self-contained JSON objects. This information, known as claims, is encoded and typically signed to ensure authenticity and integrity. A critical component of a JWT is its header, often referred to as the JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) header, which contains metadata about the token. Among this metadata, the `alg` (algorithm) parameter is paramount, as it specifies the cryptographic algorithm used to sign or encrypt the token. If not rigorously validated by the receiving server, the `alg` parameter can be manipulated by an attacker, forming the basis for several JWT vulnerabilities.

### Severity Rating: The "none" algorithm vulnerability in JWTs is typically classified with a **High🟠** severity rating

The potential consequences are severe and can include:

- **Unauthorized Access and Impersonation:** Attackers can forge the identity of any user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can modify claims to gain administrative or higher-level access.
- **Data Tampering:** Any information within the JWT payload can be altered.
- **Bypassing Security Controls:** All security mechanisms relying on the JWT's integrity become ineffective.

### **A. Defining the "None" Algorithm**

The JWT specification (RFC 7519) includes "none" as a permissible value for the `alg` header parameter. A JWT with `alg` set to "none" is termed an "Unsecured JWT". This signifies that the token bears no cryptographic signature and, consequently, offers no guarantee of integrity or authenticity. The "none" algorithm was intended for specific scenarios where the token's integrity is already assured by other means, such as during development phases or when tokens are exchanged over a highly trusted and secure channel where the risk of tampering is negligible. However, its inclusion in the specification has inadvertently become a significant source of security vulnerabilities due to misinterpretation and misapplication in real-world systems.

The vulnerability does not arise from a flaw within a cryptographic algorithm, as "none" itself provides no cryptography. Instead, it stems from the JWT specification's allowance of `alg: "none"` and, more critically, from JWT-consuming applications or libraries failing to correctly restrict or reject its use. The problem is compounded because developers might not anticipate a "no-signature" option or may misconfigure libraries that permit it by default or through easily overlooked settings.

### **B. The Inherent Security Risk**

When a server or application accepts a JWT with the `alg` header set to "none", it effectively bypasses the entire signature verification process. The server is then forced to trust the claims asserted in the token's payload without any cryptographic proof of their authenticity or that they have not been tampered with. This fundamental bypass allows an attacker to forge tokens with arbitrary claims, as no corresponding signature needs to be correctly computed or validated.

The "none" algorithm vulnerability is typically classified with a **High🟠** severity rating due to its potential impact. It is associated with several Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), including:

- CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
- CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
- CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
    

Some libraries, particularly in their earlier iterations, might have processed a token with `alg: "none"` and returned a success status for "verification." This can be dangerously misleading, as no actual cryptographic verification occurs; the library is merely acknowledging the "none" algorithm. This underscores the importance for developers to understand that, in the context of the "none" algorithm, "verification" equates to blind trust.

## **II. Exploitation Mechanics and Impact**

The exploitation of the JWT "none" algorithm vulnerability is straightforward once a vulnerable system is identified, making it a particularly dangerous flaw.

### **A. How Attackers Exploit "None"**

The attack typically unfolds in the following steps:

1. **Token Acquisition/Crafting:** The attacker obtains a legitimate JWT, perhaps issued during a normal interaction with the application, or crafts a new JWT from scratch.
2. **Header Modification:** The attacker decodes the JWT header (which is typically Base64Url encoded) and modifies the `alg` field to "none". Attackers may also attempt case variations such as "None", "NONE", or "nOnE" to bypass naive, case-sensitive checks.
    
3. **Payload Manipulation:** The attacker alters the JWT payload (also typically Base64Url encoded) to include malicious claims. This could involve changing the user ID to impersonate another user, modifying roles or permissions (e.g., setting `isAdmin: true`), or altering any other claim the application uses for authorization or business logic.
    
4. **Signature Removal:** Since the "none" algorithm implies no signature, the attacker removes the signature part of the JWT entirely or replaces it with an empty string. The forged token will then typically have the structure: `base64url(modified_header) + "." + base64url(modified_payload) + "."`.

5. **Token Submission:** The attacker submits this forged, unsigned token to the vulnerable application. If the application fails to reject tokens with `alg: "none"`, it will process the malicious payload as if it were valid.

The simplicity of this attack is an amplifying factor. Unlike vulnerabilities that require sophisticated cryptographic knowledge or significant computational resources for brute-forcing, exploiting the "none" algorithm requires only basic tools for Base64 encoding/decoding and HTTP request manipulation. This low barrier to entry means that if such a vulnerability exists, it is highly probable that it will be discovered and exploited.

### **B. Potential Consequences**

The impact of a successful "none" algorithm attack can be severe and wide-ranging:

- **Unauthorized Access and Impersonation:** Attackers can forge the identity of any legitimate user by manipulating identity-related claims (e.g., `sub`, `userId`, `email`) in the payload, thereby gaining unauthorized access to their accounts and data.
    
- **Privilege Escalation:** By altering claims related to roles, groups, or permissions (e.g., changing `role: "user"` to `role: "admin"` or setting `isAdmin: true`), attackers can escalate their privileges within the application, potentially gaining administrative control.
    
- **Data Tampering:** Any information contained within the JWT payload becomes susceptible to modification. This can lead to the corruption of application data, incorrect processing of transactions, or manipulation of application state based on the tampered claims.

- **Bypassing Security Controls:** Fundamentally, this vulnerability undermines any security mechanism that relies on the integrity and authenticity of JWT claims. Access control decisions, authorization checks, and other security-relevant logic based on JWT data become entirely ineffective.


Vulnerable implementations effectively "fail open" when encountering an `alg: "none"` token. Instead of defaulting to a secure state of distrust in the absence of a verifiable signature, they incorrectly default to trusting the attacker-supplied claims. Secure systems should always "fail closed," denying access or trust if cryptographic verification is not affirmatively and successfully completed.

## **III. The "None" Algorithm in Golang JWT Libraries**

The handling of the "none" algorithm varies across different JWT libraries available in the Golang ecosystem. Understanding these nuances is crucial for Go developers to implement JWTs securely.

### **A. `golang-jwt/jwt` (formerly `dgrijalva/jwt-go`)**

This is one of the most popular JWT libraries for Go. It incorporates specific design choices to mitigate the accidental use of the "none" algorithm:

- **Default Behavior and Safeguard:** By default, the `golang-jwt/jwt` library does not permit the "none" algorithm unless explicitly and unusually instructed. To either sign or verify a token specifying `alg: "none"`, the developer must provide the special constant `jwt.UnsafeAllowNoneSignatureType` as the key to the `Parse()`, `ParseWithClaims()`, or `SignedString()` methods. The `signingMethodNone`'s `Verify` and `Sign` methods internally check if the provided key argument is this specific "magic constant." If any other key is provided (or no key, where one is expected for other algorithms), a `NoneSignatureTypeDisallowedError` is returned. This design acts as a deliberate inconvenience, forcing developers to make a conscious and explicit decision if they intend to use this insecure mode, rather than it being an easily overlooked default.
- **Secure Parsing: `WithValidMethods()`:** The strongly recommended and most secure way to parse JWTs with this library is to use the `jwt.WithValidMethods(string{...})` parser option. This option allows developers to provide an explicit allowlist of cryptographic algorithms that the application will accept (e.g., "HS256", "RS256", "ES256"). If a token is received with an `alg` header value that is not in this allowlist (including "none"), the parsing will fail before the `Keyfunc` is even invoked. This is a primary defense mechanism.
- **Keyfunc Validation (Alternative/Additional Layer):** The `Keyfunc` is a callback function provided by the developer to the `Parse` methods, responsible for supplying the key used for signature verification. If `WithValidMethods()` is *not* used (which is highly discouraged), the `Keyfunc` becomes the critical point for algorithm validation. In such cases, the `Keyfunc` *must* inspect the `token.Method` (which is a `SigningMethod` interface) or `token.Header["alg"]` (the raw string value) and validate it against an expected list of secure algorithms before returning a key. Returning a key based solely on other header parameters like `kid` (Key ID) without verifying the `alg` would be a dangerous practice, as it could lead to algorithm confusion attacks or inadvertently allow "none" if not explicitly checked.

### **B. Other Golang JWT Libraries**

Other libraries may adopt different philosophies. For instance, the `ucarion/jwt` library takes a more restrictive stance by omitting support for the "none" algorithm entirely. Its documentation explicitly states: "Absolutely no support for the none algorithm... Tokens with none are always considered to have an invalid signature". This approach eliminates the vulnerability by design within that library.

The evolution of JWT libraries reflects a learning process. Early libraries across various languages were often more permissive or had less secure defaults regarding the "none" algorithm. Modern libraries, like the current `golang-jwt/jwt` or more opinionated ones like `ucarion/jwt`, generally provide better safeguards. However, the ultimate security still hinges on the developer understanding and correctly utilizing the features provided by the chosen library. For `golang-jwt/jwt`, while `Keyfunc` *can* be used for algorithm checking, `WithValidMethods` is the more robust and recommended approach as it centralizes the algorithm allowlist and performs the check earlier in the parsing pipeline.

The following table summarizes the handling of the "none" algorithm by these two Golang JWT libraries:

| **Library Name** | **Default Behavior for "None"** | **Mechanism to Allow "None" (if any)** | **Recommended Secure Parsing Method** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `golang-jwt/jwt` | Rejects "none" unless `jwt.UnsafeAllowNoneSignatureType` is used as the key. | Pass `jwt.UnsafeAllowNoneSignatureType` as the key in `Parse` or `Sign` functions. | Use `jwt.WithValidMethods()` option in `Parse` functions, ensuring "none" is not in the allowlist of algorithms.  |
| `ucarion/jwt` | Always rejects "none" algorithm tokens as invalid. | None. The library does not support the "none" algorithm. | The library inherently disallows "none"; standard parsing functions are secure against this specific attack.  |

## **IV. Identifying Vulnerable Go Implementations**

Detecting implementations vulnerable to the JWT "none" algorithm attack requires a combination of understanding common pitfalls, static code analysis, and thorough code reviews.

### **A. Common Misconfigurations and Coding Pitfalls**

In the context of Golang, particularly when using the `golang-jwt/jwt` library, vulnerabilities often arise from usage errors rather than flaws in the library itself (assuming an up-to-date version). Key misconfigurations include:

- **Omitting `jwt.WithValidMethods()`:** The most common pitfall is failing to use the `jwt.WithValidMethods()` option when parsing tokens with `golang-jwt/jwt`. If this option is absent, the responsibility of algorithm validation falls entirely on the `Keyfunc`. If the `Keyfunc` then fails to rigorously check the `alg` header (e.g., it only looks up a key based on `kid`), the application may become vulnerable.
    
- **Intentional (but Insecure) Use of `jwt.UnsafeAllowNoneSignatureType`:** Using `jwt.UnsafeAllowNoneSignatureType` as the key in production code to accept unsigned tokens is almost always a security vulnerability, unless there's an exceptionally well-understood and highly controlled scenario that justifies it (which is rare).
    
- **Outdated JWT Libraries:** Using older versions of `golang-jwt/jwt` (or its predecessor `dgrijalva/jwt-go`) or other less-maintained JWT libraries might expose applications to vulnerabilities that have since been patched or had their default behaviors hardened.
    
- **Flawed `Keyfunc` Logic:** If `WithValidMethods()` is not used, a `Keyfunc` that does not explicitly check `token.Method` or `token.Header["alg"]` against an allowlist of secure algorithms can be a point of failure.
- **Over-reliance on Client-Side Validation:** Assuming that tokens cannot be tampered with before reaching the server, or performing validation only on the client-side, is a critical security flaw. All JWT validation must occur server-side.

### **B. Static Analysis and Code Review**

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools and manual code reviews are vital for identifying these issues:

- **SAST Tools:** Tools can be configured to flag risky JWT handling patterns. For instance, Semgrep provides a rule specifically for the older `jwt-go` library, `go.jwt-go.security.jwt-none-alg.jwt-go-none-algorithm`, which detects the explicit use of `jwt.SigningMethodNone`. While the library name in the rule ID is dated, the pattern of searching for `SigningMethodNone` or `UnsafeAllowNoneSignatureType` remains relevant for identifying deliberate, and likely insecure, configurations.
The message for this Semgrep rule is: "Detected use of the 'none' algorithm in a JWT token. The 'none' algorithm assumes the integrity of the token has already been verified. This would allow a malicious actor to forge a JWT token that will automatically be verified. Do not explicitly use the 'none' algorithm. Instead, use an algorithm such as 'HS256'".
    
- **Manual Code Review:** Reviews should meticulously examine:
    - All invocations of `jwt.Parse()`, `jwt.ParseWithClaims()`, or similar parsing functions to ensure `jwt.WithValidMethods()` is present and correctly configured with a list of strong algorithms, explicitly excluding "none".
    - The logic within any `Keyfunc` implementation, especially if `WithValidMethods()` is absent, to confirm robust validation of the token's `alg` header or `Method` against an allowlist.
    - Any direct usage of `jwt.SigningMethodNone` or `jwt.UnsafeAllowNoneSignatureType`.
    - Error handling paths to ensure that JWT validation errors lead to request rejection.

It is important to recognize the limitations of SAST in this context. While SAST tools are effective at identifying the *presence* of insecure patterns (like the explicit use of `jwt.SigningMethodNone`), they may struggle to reliably detect the *absence* of a secure pattern (like missing `WithValidMethods()`) coupled with a subtly flawed `Keyfunc` that doesn't validate the algorithm. This is because such a scenario often requires more complex inter-procedural analysis to determine if the `Keyfunc` adequately compensates for the missing `WithValidMethods()` option. Therefore, manual code review and dynamic testing remain critical complements to SAST.

## **V. Remediation and Secure Practices in Go**

Addressing the JWT "none" algorithm vulnerability in Golang applications involves adhering to secure coding practices and leveraging the security features provided by JWT libraries.

### **A. Explicitly Disallow "None" Algorithm**

The primary defense is to ensure that the application explicitly rejects tokens that specify "none" as the algorithm.

- **For `golang-jwt/jwt` Users:** The most robust method is to consistently use the `jwt.WithValidMethods()` option when calling `jwt.Parse()` or `jwt.ParseWithClaims()`. This option should be supplied with a list of all expected, secure signing algorithms (e.g., `jwt.SigningMethodHS256.Alg()`, `jwt.SigningMethodRS256.Alg()`). Crucially, "none" must not be included in this list.
    
    - *Example:*
        
        ```Go
        
        import "github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5"
        //...
        token, err := jwt.Parse(tokenString, keyFunc, jwt.WithValidMethods(string{jwt.SigningMethodHS256.Alg(), jwt.SigningMethodRS256.Alg()}))
        ```
        
- **Server-Side Algorithm Enforcement:** Regardless of the specific library used, the server application must be configured to enforce the use of specific, strong cryptographic algorithms. It should never blindly trust the `alg` value provided in the JWT header. The application should have a predefined set of acceptable algorithms, and any token claiming a different algorithm should be rejected.
    
The design of `golang-jwt/jwt` clearly steers developers towards `WithValidMethods()` as the canonical way to define acceptable algorithms. The `UnsafeAllowNoneSignatureType` mechanism for "none" is an explicit, non-default, and inconvenient path, signaling its risky nature. Consequently, the absence of `WithValidMethods()` in parsing logic should be treated as a significant red flag during code reviews.

### **B. Secure `Keyfunc` Implementation**

If, for some unavoidable reason, `WithValidMethods()` cannot be used (a scenario that should be extremely rare and heavily scrutinized), the `Keyfunc` implementation becomes the last line of defense for algorithm validation. In such cases, the `Keyfunc` *must*:

1. Inspect the `token.Method` (which is of type `jwt.SigningMethod`) or the raw `token.Header["alg"]` string.
2. Compare this against an allowlist of secure algorithms expected by the application.
3. Return an error immediately if an unexpected algorithm (especially "none") is encountered, preventing the return of any key.

This approach is less robust than using `WithValidMethods()` because it decentralizes algorithm validation logic and is more prone to implementation errors.

### **C. Library Updates and Selection**

- **Keep Libraries Updated:** JWT libraries, including `golang-jwt/jwt`, should be kept up-to-date with their latest stable releases. Updates often include security patches, bug fixes, and hardened default behaviors.
    
- **Consider Stricter Libraries:** For projects where simplicity and a highly opinionated security posture are desired, consider libraries like `ucarion/jwt` that disallow the "none" algorithm by design, thereby eliminating this specific risk vector. The choice between a flexible library (like `golang-jwt/jwt`) and a more restrictive one involves a trade-off: flexibility often requires more developer diligence to ensure secure configuration, while restrictive libraries might offer fewer features but a smaller attack surface for certain vulnerabilities.
    
### **D. General JWT Best Practices**

While not exclusively for preventing "none" algorithm attacks, adhering to general JWT security best practices strengthens overall security:

- Use strong, unpredictable secret keys for HMAC algorithms and robust key pairs for asymmetric algorithms.
- Protect signing keys diligently; private keys for asymmetric algorithms must remain confidential.
- Always set a reasonable expiration time (`exp` claim) for tokens.
- Validate all relevant claims, such as issuer (`iss`) and audience (`aud`), in addition to the signature and expiration.
- Transmit JWTs exclusively over HTTPS to prevent interception.
    
## **VI. Conclusion**

The JWT "none" algorithm vulnerability represents a critical security flaw that, if present, allows attackers to completely bypass signature verification mechanisms. This can lead to severe consequences, including unauthorized access, impersonation, and privilege escalation within affected applications. Due to the relative ease of crafting a malicious "none" token once a vulnerability is identified, its impact is often high.

For Go developers, particularly those utilizing the `golang-jwt/jwt` library, proactive security measures are paramount. The library provides robust mechanisms, such as the `jwt.WithValidMethods()` parser option, to explicitly define and enforce an allowlist of secure cryptographic algorithms, thereby rejecting tokens that illegitimately claim `alg: "none"`. The alternative of using `jwt.UnsafeAllowNoneSignatureType` is a deliberate hurdle, signaling the inherent risk and discouraging its use in production environments. The "none" algorithm vulnerability is a persistent threat, primarily because new projects or developers unfamiliar with JWT intricacies can inadvertently introduce it through misconfiguration. The fact that libraries might provide a (safeguarded) way to use "none" means the potential for misuse persists if secure defaults or recommended practices are not followed.

The Golang ecosystem offers capable JWT libraries and static analysis tools like Semgrep that can aid in identifying some insecure patterns. However, the ultimate responsibility for secure implementation rests with the developer. Diligent application of library security features, thorough code reviews focusing on JWT parsing and validation logic, and staying informed about JWT best practices and library updates are essential components of a strong security posture when working with JSON Web Tokens in Go applications. Security is not a feature to be added最後に; it requires continuous vigilance and adherence to established secure coding principles.
