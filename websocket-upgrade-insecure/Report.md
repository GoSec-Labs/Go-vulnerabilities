# **Insecure WebSocket Upgrade (Leading to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking) in Golang Applications**

## **1. Vulnerability Title**

Insecure WebSocket Upgrade (Leading to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking) in Golang Applications.

(Commonly tracked as websocket-upgrade-insecure or related to CWE-1385)

## **2. Severity Rating**

**Variable (MediumðŸŸ¡ to CriticalðŸ”´)**

The severity of an Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerability is not fixed and depends significantly on the context of the application and the data or functionalities exposed through the WebSocket connection. When this vulnerability leads to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score can range widely.

For example:

- CVE-2024-8201, a CSWH vulnerability in Hitachi Ops Center Analyzer, was rated 5.4 (Medium). This suggests that the potential impact in that specific context, such as loss of confidentiality or integrity, was considered limited.

- In contrast, CVE-2024-11045, a CSWH vulnerability in automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui, received a CVSS score of 9.6 (Critical). This indicates that the hijacked WebSocket could be used to perform highly privileged actions or access very sensitive data.
    

The discrepancy in these scores underscores that the core vulnerabilityâ€”the insecure upgrade mechanism, typically a failure to validate the `Origin` headerâ€”is a *gateway*. The actual damage an attacker can inflict by exploiting this gateway dictates the true severity. If the WebSocket is used for broadcasting public, non-sensitive information, the impact of a hijack might be low. However, if the WebSocket handles sensitive user data, financial transactions, or administrative commands, a hijack could lead to severe consequences, including significant data breaches, financial fraud, or full account takeover. Therefore, organizations must assess the severity based on their specific implementation and the potential impact of a compromised WebSocket session within their environment.

## **3. Description**

An Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerability occurs when a Golang application improperly handles the initial HTTP handshake process required to establish a WebSocket connection. The most common manifestation of this vulnerability is the server's failure to adequately validate the `Origin` header of the incoming HTTP upgrade request. This oversight allows an attacker to craft a malicious webpage that, when visited by a victim, can initiate a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable Golang application from an unauthorized, attacker-controlled origin, all within the context of the victim user's browser session (typically leveraging the victim's existing session cookies).

The primary and most severe consequence of this vulnerability is Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH). CSWH enables an attacker to effectively take over the victim's WebSocket communication channel. Through this hijacked connection, the attacker can send messages to the server as if they were the victim and receive messages intended for the victim. This can lead to a range of malicious outcomes, including unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user, theft of sensitive data transmitted over the WebSocket, and potentially deeper session compromise, depending on the application's functionality.

It is important to understand that the term "upgrade" in "WebSocket upgrade" refers to a protocol switch from HTTP to WebSocket. This transition does not inherently imply an upgrade in security; rather, it introduces a new set of security considerations that must be actively addressed by the application. The "insecurity" arises when these new requirements, particularly around origin validation, are neglected during this protocol transition.

## **4. Technical Description (for security pros)**

The WebSocket protocol, defined in RFC 6455, enables full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The establishment of this channel begins with an HTTP-based handshake.

**The WebSocket Handshake (RFC 6455):**

1. **Client Request:** The client initiates the handshake with an HTTP/1.1 GET request to the server. This request must include specific headers:
    - `Host`: The hostname of the server.
    - `Upgrade: websocket`: Indicates the desire to switch protocols.
    - `Connection: Upgrade`: Signals the connection upgrade.
    - `Sec-WebSocket-Key`: A Base64-encoded random 16-byte nonce generated by the client. This key is not for security in terms of authentication or session handling, but rather to help prevent issues with misconfigured proxies and to confirm the server's understanding of the WebSocket protocol.

    - `Sec-WebSocket-Version`: Specifies the WebSocket protocol version, which is typically 13 for modern implementations.
    - `Origin`: When the WebSocket connection is initiated by a web browser, the browser automatically includes an `Origin` header. This header indicates the scheme, hostname, and port of the webpage that executed the script initiating the WebSocket connection. This header is fundamental to the browser's same-origin security model and is critical for preventing CSWH.
        
2. **Server Response:** If the server accepts the WebSocket connection, it responds with an HTTP status code 101 (Switching Protocols). The server's response must also include :
    - `Upgrade: websocket`
    - `Connection: Upgrade`
    - `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`: This header's value is derived by taking the client's `Sec-WebSocket-Key`, appending the globally unique identifier (GUID) "258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11", computing the SHA-1 hash of the concatenated string, and then Base64 encoding the hash. This mechanism confirms to the client that the server understood the WebSocket handshake.

The "Insecure" Aspect - Missing or Improper Origin Validation:

The vulnerability materializes when the server-side Golang application fails to properly validate the Origin header received in the client's handshake request. According to OWASP guidelines and the security considerations in RFC 6455, it is the server's explicit responsibility to verify that the Origin is from an expected and trusted domain before completing the handshake.3 If the server either:

- Does not check the `Origin` header at all,
- Implements a check that is too permissive (e.g., allows any origin, reflects the received origin back as allowed), or
- Has a flawed allowlist of trusted origins,
then the upgrade process is insecure. This oversight breaks the origin-based security model that WebSockets rely upon when initiated from browsers.

Leading to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH):

When Origin validation is absent or flawed, the application becomes susceptible to CSWH. The attack unfolds as follows:

1. An attacker hosts a malicious webpage on their own domain (e.g., `http://evil.com`).
2. A victim user, who is currently authenticated to the vulnerable Golang application (e.g., `https://vulnerable.com`), is lured to visit the attacker's webpage.
3. JavaScript code on `http://evil.com` attempts to establish a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable application's WebSocket endpoint (e.g., `wss://vulnerable.com/ws`).
4. The victim's browser, when making this cross-origin WebSocket handshake request, will automatically include any relevant cookies (e.g., session cookies) associated with `vulnerable.com`. The `Origin` header in this request will be `http://evil.com`.
    
5. If the server at `vulnerable.com` does not validate the `Origin` header, it will likely proceed with the handshake, relying on the presence of valid session cookies to authenticate the connection. It mistakenly trusts the connection because of the cookies, despite it originating from an untrusted domain.
6. Upon successful handshake (server responds with HTTP 101), the attacker's script executing on `http://evil.com` now has an active, two-way WebSocket communication channel with `vulnerable.com`. This channel operates within the security context of the victim's authenticated session.
    
7. The attacker can now send arbitrary messages to the server via this hijacked WebSocket and read any messages sent back by the server to the victim, effectively hijacking the WebSocket functionality for that user.

It is crucial to note that using `wss://` (WebSocket over TLS) encrypts the data in transit, protecting against network eavesdropping (Man-in-the-Middle attacks on the wire). However, `wss://` does *not* prevent CSWH if `Origin` validation is missing. CSWH is an application-level vulnerability that exploits flawed server-side authorization logic during the handshake, not a deficiency in transport-layer encryption. Both `wss://` and robust `Origin` validation are necessary for secure WebSocket deployments.

## **5. Common Mistakes That Cause This**

The Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerability in Golang applications typically stems from specific misconfigurations or oversights in how WebSocket libraries are used or how custom handshake logic is implemented. Some of the most common mistakes include:

- **No Origin Check:** The most direct cause is the complete omission of any validation for the `Origin` header during the WebSocket handshake. The server simply accepts any upgrade request without verifying where it came from.
- **Permissive `CheckOrigin` in `gorilla/websocket`:** A widely used library, `github.com/gorilla/websocket`, provides an `Upgrader` struct with a `CheckOrigin` field. A common mistake is to set this to a function that always returns `true`, effectively disabling the origin check:

This is often done during development for convenience to allow connections from any local test server or `file://` origins but is highly insecure if deployed to production. The library's default behavior (if `CheckOrigin` is `nil`) is safer as it compares the `Origin` header to the `Host` header.

    ```Go
    
    var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
        CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool { return true },
    }
    ```

- **Using `InsecureSkipVerify` in `coder/websocket`:** The `github.com/coder/websocket` library (formerly `nhooyr.io/websocket`) offers an `AcceptOptions` struct. Setting `InsecureSkipVerify: true` in these options explicitly disables origin verification. This is a dangerous setting intended for specific scenarios but can be misused.
    

- **Overly Broad `OriginPatterns` in `coder/websocket`:** When using `AcceptOptions.OriginPatterns` in `coder/websocket` to specify allowed origins, developers might use wildcard patterns like `"*"` (which is strongly discouraged by the library's documentation due to security risks ) or overly permissive regular expressions. This can inadvertently allow connections from unintended or malicious origins.
    

- **Flawed Custom Origin Validation Logic:** If developers implement their own origin validation logic, it may contain errors such as incorrect string matching (e.g., using `strings.Contains` instead of exact matching or proper subdomain checking), improper handling of ports, or allowlists that are too broad, poorly maintained, or incorrectly parsed.
- **Relying Solely on Cookies for Session Management:** A fundamental misunderstanding is assuming that because the HTTP upgrade request carries session cookies, the WebSocket connection is inherently secure against cross-origin attacks. This neglects the need for CSRF-like protection (i.e., `Origin` header validation or token-based checks) specifically for the WebSocket handshake itself.
    
- **Misunderstanding `golang.org/x/net/websocket` Defaults or Lack of Features:** The older `golang.org/x/net/websocket` package is less actively maintained and may lack some of the more explicit security controls or clear guidance found in newer libraries. Developers using this package might need to be more proactive in implementing custom origin checks within the `websocket.Server.Handshake` function or their HTTP handler, and omissions can easily occur.

    
- **Ignoring Security Implications of `ws://`:** While not a direct cause of CSWH if `Origin` validation is correctly implemented, using unencrypted `ws://` in conjunction with a missing or flawed `Origin` check significantly compounds the risks. If a CSWH attack is successful, the unencrypted channel means all hijacked communications are also exposed to network eavesdroppers.
    
A recurring theme in these mistakes is that features or practices intended for flexibility or to ease development (e.g., permissive `CheckOrigin` functions, `InsecureSkipVerify` flags) become significant vulnerabilities when their security implications are not fully understood or when development configurations are inadvertently promoted to production environments. The path of least resistance during initial setup or local testing can often be an insecure one if not carefully managed before deployment.

## **6. Exploitation Goals**

Attackers who successfully exploit an Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerability to achieve Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH) typically aim for one or more of the following goals:

- **Session Hijacking/Impersonation:** The primary goal is often to gain control of the victim's authenticated WebSocket session. By establishing a WebSocket connection from a malicious origin in the context of the victim's browser (which includes their session cookies), the attacker can effectively impersonate the victim for all interactions occurring over that WebSocket.
    
- **Unauthorized Data Access/Exfiltration:** If the WebSocket is used to transmit sensitive information from the server to the client (e.g., private messages in a chat application, personal user details, financial data, proprietary business information), the attacker can intercept and read this data through the hijacked connection. The attacker's malicious script can listen for messages from the server and exfiltrate them to an attacker-controlled server.
    
- **Performing Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can send commands or messages through the hijacked WebSocket to trigger server-side actions that the victim is authorized to perform. This could include modifying user profile data, posting content as the victim, making unauthorized purchases, deleting data, or initiating other state-changing operations available through the WebSocket API.
    
- **Bypassing CSRF Protections for WebSocket-Based Actions:** CSWH can be seen as a more potent form of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) specifically for WebSocket interactions. Traditional CSRF attacks are often "fire and forget," where the attacker tricks the victim into sending a request but doesn't typically see the response. CSWH, however, provides the attacker with a two-way communication channel, allowing them to send commands and receive responses, making it far more interactive and dangerous.
    
- **Compromising Server or Other Users (Indirectly):** In some scenarios, if the hijacked WebSocket can be used to inject malicious data that is then processed insecurely by the server or rendered by other clients (e.g., sending a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payload as a message that other users will view), this could be a secondary goal, potentially escalating the attack's impact.

The "two-way" interactive nature of CSWH is a critical distinction from traditional CSRF and significantly elevates its potential impact. Attackers are not limited to blindly sending commands; they can actively observe the results of their actions and adapt their strategy in real-time, making the exploitation more dynamic and potentially more damaging. This allows for complex, multi-step attacks and more effective data exfiltration than what is typically possible with standard CSRF.

## **7. Affected Components or Files**

The Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerability primarily affects the server-side components of a Golang application responsible for establishing and managing WebSocket connections. Specific components and files include:

- **Golang WebSocket Server Implementations:** Any Go application that acts as a WebSocket server and includes logic for handling the HTTP upgrade handshake is potentially affected if origin validation is not correctly implemented.
- **HTTP Request Handlers:** The Go code, often an `http.HandlerFunc` or a method on an `http.Handler`, that receives the initial HTTP GET request from the client and is responsible for invoking the WebSocket library's upgrade function. This is where the decision to upgrade the connection is made and where origin checks should occur.
- **WebSocket Libraries and their Configurations:** The vulnerability often manifests in how specific Golang WebSocket libraries are configured and used:
    - **`github.com/gorilla/websocket`:** Files where `websocket.Upgrader` is instantiated and its `CheckOrigin` field is configured. If `CheckOrigin` is `nil`, a default (safer) check is used. If it's explicitly set to a function, that function's logic determines security.

    - **`github.com/coder/websocket` (formerly `nhooyr.io/websocket`):** Files where `websocket.Accept` is called with `websocket.AcceptOptions`. The values of `InsecureSkipVerify` and `OriginPatterns` within these options are critical.
        
    - **`golang.org/x/net/websocket`:** Files where `websocket.Server` is configured or `websocket.Handler` is used. This older package may require more manual implementation of handshake logic, including origin checks, making the application code itself the primary affected component. The package is also noted as being less actively maintained than alternatives.
    
- **Configuration Files or Environment Variables:** If the allowlist of trusted origins or other security-related settings for WebSocket upgrades are managed through external configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML,.env files) or environment variables, then these files and the logic that parses them are also part of the affected component chain. Incorrect values or parsing errors in these configurations can lead to the vulnerability.

It's important to understand that the vulnerability is not typically an inherent flaw in the Go language itself or a bug within the core logic of well-maintained WebSocket libraries (when used correctly). Instead, it arises from how these libraries' features are *used* or *configured* by developers, or due to omissions in custom-implemented security checks. The libraries provide the tools and mechanisms for establishing WebSocket connections, including options for security controls like origin validation; the insecure upgrade occurs when these controls are improperly applied or bypassed by the application code. This emphasizes the critical role of developer awareness and secure coding practices in preventing this vulnerability.

## **8. Vulnerable Code Snippet**

The following code snippets illustrate how an Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerability can manifest in Golang applications using common WebSocket libraries. These examples demonstrate configurations that fail to properly validate the `Origin` header, leading to susceptibility to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH).

**1. Using `github.com/gorilla/websocket` with a Permissive `CheckOrigin` Function:**

```Go

package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/gorilla/websocket"
)

// Vulnerable: CheckOrigin function allows all origins.
var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
    ReadBufferSize:  1024,
    WriteBufferSize: 1024,
    CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {
        // This explicitly bypasses the default, safer origin check
        // by always returning true.
        log.Printf("Allowing origin: %s (VULNERABLE CONFIGURATION)", r.Header.Get("Origin"))
        return true
    },
}

func wsHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
    if err!= nil {
        log.Println("Upgrade error:", err)
        return
    }
    defer conn.Close()

    log.Printf("Client connected: %s", conn.RemoteAddr())

    // Example echo functionality
    for {
        messageType, message, err := conn.ReadMessage()
        if err!= nil {
            if websocket.IsUnexpectedCloseError(err, websocket.CloseGoingAway, websocket.CloseAbnormalClosure) {
                log.Printf("Read error: %v", err)
            }
            break
        }
        log.Printf("Received from %s: type %d, message: %s", conn.RemoteAddr(), messageType, string(message))

        if err := conn.WriteMessage(messageType, message); err!= nil {
            log.Println("Write error:", err)
            break
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/ws", wsHandler)
    log.Println("Starting server on :8080")
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

- **Explanation of Vulnerability:** In this snippet , the `upgrader.CheckOrigin` function is explicitly defined to `return true` for any request. This means the WebSocket server will accept upgrade requests from any origin, making it vulnerable to CSWH. The default behavior of `gorilla/websocket` (if `CheckOrigin` is `nil`) is to compare the `Origin` request header with the `Host` request header, which is a safer default. By overriding it with a function that always returns `true`, this protection is disabled.


**2. Using `github.com/coder/websocket` (formerly `nhooyr.io/websocket`) with `InsecureSkipVerify`:**

```Go

package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "time"

    "nhooyr.io/websocket" // Or "github.com/coder/websocket"
)

func wsHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    opts := &websocket.AcceptOptions{
        // Vulnerable: InsecureSkipVerify explicitly disables origin verification.
        InsecureSkipVerify: true,
    }

    conn, err := websocket.Accept(w, r, opts)
    if err!= nil {
        log.Println("Accept error:", err)
        // websocket.Accept handles writing the HTTP error response.
        return
    }
    // According to nhooyr.io/websocket docs, Close should be called with a status and reason.
    // If an error occurs making it impossible to determine a status, CloseNow can be used.
    defer conn.Close(websocket.StatusInternalError, "the sky is falling")

    log.Printf("Client connected (InsecureSkipVerify=true)")

    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(r.Context(), time.Second*30)
    defer cancel()

    // Example echo functionality
    messageType, data, err := conn.Read(ctx)
    if err!= nil {
        log.Println("Read error:", err)
        conn.Close(websocket.StatusUnsupportedData, "read error")
        return
    }
    log.Printf("Received: type %v, data %s", messageType, string(data))

    err = conn.Write(ctx, messageType, data)
    if err!= nil {
        log.Println("Write error:", err)
        // No need to close again, defer will handle it.
        return
    }

    conn.Close(websocket.StatusNormalClosure, "echo successful")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/ws", wsHandler)
    log.Println("Starting server on :8080")
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

- **Explanation of Vulnerability:** This snippet  uses `websocket.AcceptOptions` with `InsecureSkipVerify: true`. This flag explicitly instructs the library to bypass the standard origin verification process. As a result, the server will accept WebSocket upgrade requests from any origin, creating a CSWH vulnerability. The library documentation for `coder/websocket` typically warns that `OriginPatterns` should be used instead of `InsecureSkipVerify` for allowing cross-origin requests in a controlled manner.

These vulnerable code patterns often arise when developers prioritize ease of setup or follow basic examples without fully considering the security ramifications. The vulnerability is frequently one of omission (failing to implement strict checks) or explicit commission (intentionally disabling security checks, often for development convenience, which then persists into production). Many introductory examples for WebSocket libraries might showcase permissive origin checks to simplify initial testing (e.g., allowing connections from `file://` URIs or different local ports), without adequately stressing that such configurations are unsafe for production environments.

## **9. Detection Steps**

Detecting Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerabilities requires a multi-faceted approach, combining static code analysis, dynamic testing, and awareness of library-specific configurations.

1. Source Code Review (Static Analysis):

This is often the most effective way to find these vulnerabilities.

- **Identify WebSocket Handlers:** Locate the Golang code responsible for handling HTTP requests that are upgraded to WebSocket connections (typically `http.HandlerFunc` implementations).
- **Inspect Library Usage:**
    - For `github.com/gorilla/websocket`: Examine the `websocket.Upgrader` instance. Specifically, scrutinize the `CheckOrigin` function. Look for:
        - `CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool { return true }` (a clear indicator of vulnerability).
        - Logic that is too permissive (e.g., checks for subdomains insecurely, allows overly broad patterns, or has an empty allowlist).
        - If `CheckOrigin` is `nil`, the library uses a safer default (comparing `Origin` to `Host`), which is generally secure for same-origin policies but might need adjustment for deliberate cross-origin scenarios.

    - For `github.com/coder/websocket` (or `nhooyr.io/websocket`): Check the `websocket.AcceptOptions` passed to `websocket.Accept()`. Look for:
        - `InsecureSkipVerify: true` (a direct indicator of vulnerability).

        - `OriginPatterns` that are overly broad, such as `string{"*"}` (explicitly discouraged ), or use weak regular expressions that match unintended origins.

    - For `golang.org/x/net/websocket`: This package is less prescriptive. Verify how the `websocket.Server{Handshake:...}` field is configured or if custom logic before calling `websocket.Handler(...).ServeHTTP` performs an explicit check of `r.Header.Get("Origin")` against a strict allowlist.
        
- **Review Origin Allowlist Logic:** If an allowlist of origins is used, ensure it is correctly implemented, securely loaded (not hardcoded if it needs to be dynamic), and matches only intended origins (scheme, host, and port).

2. Dynamic Analysis / Penetration Testing:

This involves actively testing the live WebSocket endpoint.

- **Use a Web Proxy:** Tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite are essential. Configure the browser or client application to route traffic through the proxy.
    
- **Initiate Handshake and Intercept:** Perform a legitimate WebSocket handshake from the application's UI. Intercept the outgoing HTTP GET request that includes the `Upgrade: websocket` header.
- **Modify the `Origin` Header:** Change the value of the `Origin` header in the intercepted request to a completely different, untrusted origin (e.g., `http://evil.com`, `https://attacker.example`).
- **Forward and Observe:** Forward the modified request to the server.
    - If the server responds with HTTP 101 (Switching Protocols), the WebSocket connection is established despite the spoofed origin. This indicates a vulnerability.
        
    - If the server responds with an error (e.g., HTTP 403 Forbidden), it likely has some form of origin validation.
- **Test Communication:** If the connection is established with the spoofed origin, attempt to send and receive messages over this WebSocket to confirm full hijack capability.

**3. Automated Scanning Tools:**

- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** Some SAST tools can identify common insecure patterns in code. For instance, Semgrep has rules available to detect missing or permissive `CheckOrigin` configurations in `gorilla/websocket` code.
    
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):** DAST tools can automate the process of sending HTTP requests with modified headers, including the `Origin` header for WebSocket handshakes. Some DAST solutions are capable of identifying insecure WebSocket patterns by observing server responses.
    

4. Browser Developer Tools:

For a quick, basic check:

- Create a simple HTML page with JavaScript to initiate a WebSocket connection to the target server.
- Host this HTML page on a completely different domain (or even locally as a `file://` URI, though browser behavior with `Origin` for local files can vary).
- Open the browser's developer tools (Network tab) and attempt the connection.
- Observe if the WebSocket connection is successfully established. If it is, and the `Origin` header sent by the browser (visible in the request details) was for the different domain/local file, this strongly suggests a lack of server-side `Origin` validation.
    
Effective detection often requires a combination of these methods. Static analysis can pinpoint suspicious code patterns, while dynamic analysis confirms the actual behavior and exploitability of the server with manipulated `Origin` headers. This is particularly important because custom origin validation logic might appear secure in code but have subtle flaws that only dynamic testing can reveal. For instance, if an allowlist is managed externally (e.g., in a database or config file), SAST might not have visibility into its contents, whereas DAST will test the live, effective configuration.

## **10. Proof of Concept (PoC)**

This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerability can be exploited to achieve Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH). It involves a vulnerable server that fails to validate the `Origin` header and an attacker's webpage that initiates a WebSocket connection in the context of a victim's browser session.

**Scenario:**

- **Vulnerable Application:** Hosted at `https://vulnerable.com`. It has a WebSocket endpoint at `wss://vulnerable.com/ws` that requires cookie-based authentication for user-specific actions (e.g., an echo service that also logs messages or performs user-specific tasks). The server does not validate the `Origin` header during the WebSocket handshake.
- **Attacker's Malicious Page:** Hosted at `http://evil.com/exploit.html`.
- **Victim:** A user who is currently authenticated (has an active session cookie) with `https://vulnerable.com`.

1. Vulnerable Golang Server (vulnerable.com/ws):

(Using gorilla/websocket with permissive CheckOrigin as an example from Section 8)

```Go

package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/gorilla/websocket"
)

var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
    CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {
        log.Printf("Vulnerable server: Allowing connection from Origin: %s", r.Header.Get("Origin"))
        return true // Vulnerable: Accepts any origin
    },
}

func wsHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Simulate checking for an authentication cookie
    sessionCookie, err := r.Cookie("session_id")
    if err!= nil {
        http.Error(w, "Unauthorized: Missing session cookie", http.StatusUnauthorized)
        log.Println("Attempted connection without session cookie.")
        return
    }
    log.Printf("Authenticated user (session: %s) attempting WebSocket upgrade.", sessionCookie.Value)

    conn, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
    if err!= nil {
        log.Println("Upgrade error:", err)
        return
    }
    defer conn.Close()
    log.Printf("Client %s connected via WebSocket.", conn.RemoteAddr())

    for {
        mt, message, err := conn.ReadMessage()
        if err!= nil {
            log.Println("Read error:", err)
            break
        }
        log.Printf("User (session: %s) sent: %s", sessionCookie.Value, string(message))
        // Echo back the message
        response :=byte("Server received from user (session " + sessionCookie.Value + "): " + string(message))
        if err := conn.WriteMessage(mt, response); err!= nil {
            log.Println("Write error:", err)
            break
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/ws", wsHandler)
    // Dummy login to set a cookie for PoC purposes
    http.HandleFunc("/login", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        cookie := http.Cookie{Name: "session_id", Value: "victim_session_123", Path: "/"}
        http.SetCookie(w, &cookie)
        w.Write(byte("Logged in successfully! Now try the PoC."))
    })

**3. Exploitation Steps:**

1. The attacker hosts `exploit.html` on their server, accessible via `http://evil.com/exploit.html`. (For local testing, save it as an HTML file and open it in the browser).
2. The victim first logs into `https://vulnerable.com` (or `http://localhost:8080/login` in the local PoC), establishing an authenticated session and receiving a session cookie.
3. The attacker tricks the victim into visiting `http://evil.com/exploit.html`.
4. The JavaScript on `exploit.html` executes in the victim's browser.
5. The `new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/ws')` call initiates a WebSocket handshake request. The victim's browser automatically includes the `session_id` cookie for `localhost:8080` (or `vulnerable.com`). The `Origin` header of this request will be `http://evil.com` (or `null` / `file://` if opened locally, which many permissive `CheckOrigin` functions allow).
6. The vulnerable Golang server at `localhost:8080/ws` receives the request. Because `CheckOrigin` returns `true`, it accepts the connection despite the mismatched/untrusted origin. It sees the `session_id` cookie and processes the WebSocket connection as if it were a legitimate, same-origin request from the victim.
7. The `ws.onopen` function in `exploit.html` fires. The attacker's script can now:
    - Send messages (`ws.send(...)`) to the server. These messages will be processed by the server under the victim's authenticated session.
    - Receive messages (`ws.onmessage =...`) sent by the server to the victim, effectively exfiltrating data.
8. The server logs will show messages being received from the victim's session, but these are actually being sent by the attacker's script.

This PoC demonstrates that the attacker, from their own domain, can interact with the vulnerable WebSocket server as if they were the victim, leveraging the victim's authenticated session. The effectiveness hinges on the victim having an active, authenticated session with `vulnerable.com` when they visit the attacker's page, as CSWH typically exploits the browser's automatic handling of cookies for the target domain during cross-origin requests.**4**

## **11. Risk Classification**

The risk posed by an Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerability, leading to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH), can be assessed using the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology. This methodology considers both the Likelihood of exploitation and the Impact of a successful exploit. The overall severity is highly contextual, as demonstrated by varying CVSS scores for CSWH in different applications. The associated Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is CWE-1385: Missing Origin Validation in WebSockets.

A. Likelihood Estimation:

Likelihood factors are scored from 0 (worst-case for defender) to 9 (best-case for defender). For calculation, these are often inverted or a scale of 1-9 (low to high likelihood for attacker) is used. Here, we use the 1-9 scale where higher means more likely for an attacker.

- **Threat Agent Factors:**
    - **Skill Level:** An attacker needs to understand web technologies, JavaScript, and WebSocket interactions, and be able to host a malicious webpage. This ranges from *Some technical skills (3)* to *Network and programming skills (6)*.
    - **Motive:** Varies greatly depending on the application's value. Could be *Low or no reward (1)* (e.g., for a simple chat app with no sensitive data) to *High reward (9)* (e.g., for financial applications or those handling PII).
    - **Opportunity:** Requires the victim to visit a malicious page. This typically involves some form of social engineering or exploiting another vulnerability (e.g., XSS on a popular site to iframe the malicious page). *Some access or resources required (7)*.
    - **Size:** The group of potential attackers can be large, effectively *Anonymous Internet users (9)*.
- **Vulnerability Factors:**
    - **Ease of Discovery:** Missing or permissive `Origin` checks can be relatively easy to discover through manual testing with proxies or automated DAST tools. Common misconfigurations in popular libraries are well-known. *Easy (7)*. Automated tools like Semgrep can find specific patterns in code.
        
    - **Ease of Exploit:** Once the vulnerability is discovered and a vulnerable WebSocket endpoint is identified, crafting the malicious JavaScript for CSWH is straightforward for a skilled attacker. The main hurdle is luring the victim. *Easy (5)*.
    - **Awareness:** CSWH and the importance of `Origin` validation are well-documented security concepts. *Public knowledge (9)*.

        
    - **Intrusion Detection:** This is often a weak point. Standard HTTP logs might show the initial 101 upgrade but may not log the `Origin` header or the success/failure of its validation. WebSocket message traffic itself is typically not logged by default web servers. Unless specific application-level logging for WebSocket `Origin` checks and subsequent message activity is implemented and actively monitored, detection is difficult. This often scores as *Logged without review (8)* or *Not logged (9)*.

**Example Likelihood Score:** Averaging these factors might place the likelihood in the **Medium (e.g., 6-7)** range, but this can vary.

B. Impact Estimation:

Impact factors are scored based on the negative consequences for the business/application.

- **Technical Impact:**
    - **Loss of Confidentiality:** Depends entirely on what data is transmitted over the WebSocket. Could range from *Minimal non-sensitive data disclosed (2)* to *Extensive critical data disclosed (7)* or even *All data disclosed (9)* if the WebSocket is a primary channel for sensitive information.

    - **Loss of Integrity:** Depends on what actions can be performed via the WebSocket. Could range from *Minimal slightly corrupt data (1)* (e.g., sending a chat message as someone else) to *Extensive seriously corrupt data (7)* or *All data totally corrupt (9)* (e.g., modifying critical user settings, executing unauthorized transactions).
    - **Loss of Availability:** Typically *None (0)* directly from CSWH, as the attack hijacks an existing session rather than denying service. However, actions performed through the hijacked session could potentially lead to DoS for the victim's account or, in extreme cases, impact server resources if many sessions are misused.
    - **Loss of Accountability:** Actions are performed under the victim's legitimate session, making it appear as if the victim performed them. This can be *Possibly traceable (7)* if detailed application logs exist but are initially misleading, or *Completely anonymous (9)* from the attacker's perspective if logs are poor.
- **Business Impact:** Derived from the technical impact. Can include:
    - Reputational damage and loss of user trust.
    - Financial losses (e.g., fraudulent transactions, recovery costs).
    - Legal and regulatory fines (e.g., for data breaches).
    - Operational costs for investigation and remediation.

**Example Impact Score:** Highly variable. For a system like CVE-2024-8201 (Hitachi Ops Center Analyzer, CVSS 5.4), impact might be Low-Medium. For a system like CVE-2024-11045 (stable-diffusion-webui, CVSS 9.6), impact is High-Critical. Let's assume a **Medium to High (e.g., 6-8)** impact for a typical application with moderately sensitive data/actions.

C. Overall Severity Determination:

Using the OWASP matrix (Likelihood x Impact):

|  | **Impact: LOW (0-3)** | **Impact: MEDIUM (4-6)** | **Impact: HIGH (7-9)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Likelihood: HIGH (7-9)** | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL |
| **Likelihood: MEDIUM (4-6)** | LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| **Likelihood: LOW (0-3)** | NOTE | LOW | MEDIUM |

Given an example Likelihood of **Medium** and an Impact of **Medium-High**, the Overall Severity would typically be **High**. If impact is critical, severity becomes Critical. If impact is low, severity would be Medium or Low.

The lack of robust intrusion detection capabilities for this specific attack vector is a significant concern. Standard web server logs often do not capture the necessary details (like the `Origin` header of the upgrade request and whether it was validated correctly) to easily identify CSWH attempts. Application-level logging of WebSocket connection attempts, `Origin` validation results, and session activity is crucial for detection and forensics, but is frequently overlooked.

## **12. Fix & Patch Guidance**

The primary fix for Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerabilities is to implement strict server-side validation of the `Origin` header during the initial HTTP handshake. Defense-in-depth strategies, such as token-based authentication for the handshake and consistent use of TLS, should also be employed.

1. Implement Strict Origin Validation (Primary and Most Critical Fix):

The server MUST validate the Origin header sent by the client against an allowlist of trusted origins. If the Origin header is not present or does not match an entry in the allowlist, the server should reject the WebSocket upgrade request, typically by responding with an HTTP 403 Forbidden status code, before establishing the WebSocket connection.5

The following table outlines secure configurations for common Golang WebSocket libraries:

| **Library** | **Key Struct/Function for Upgrade** | **Secure Configuration for Origin Check (Conceptual)** | **Insecure Configuration Example (Conceptual)** | **Notes on Default Behavior** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `github.com/gorilla/websocket` | `websocket.Upgrader` | `upgrader.CheckOrigin = func(r *http.Request) bool { return isAllowedOrigin(r.Header.Get("Origin"),string{"https://yourdomain.com"}) }` | `upgrader.CheckOrigin = func(r *http.Request) bool { return true }` | If `CheckOrigin` is `nil`, default compares `Origin` to `Host` (safer for same-origin). |
| `github.com/coder/websocket` (formerly `nhooyr.io/websocket`) | `websocket.AcceptOptions` | `opts := &websocket.AcceptOptions{ OriginPatterns:string{"yourdomain.com", "sub.yourdomain.com"} }` | `opts := &websocket.AcceptOptions{ InsecureSkipVerify: true }` OR `OriginPatterns:string{"*"}` | Default is `InsecureSkipVerify: false` (secure). `OriginPatterns` must be specific. |
| `golang.org/x/net/websocket` | `websocket.Server` or `websocket.Handler` | Custom check: `if!isAllowedOrigin(req.Header.Get("Origin"), allowed) { http.Error(w, "Forbidden", 403); return }` OR via `Server.Handshake` field. | No explicit check of `Origin` header. | Requires more manual implementation of checks.**19** |

    }
    ```
    

2. Token-Based Authentication for WebSocket Handshake (Defense-in-Depth):

As an additional layer of protection, especially if there's a risk of XSS on a trusted origin, implement token-based authentication for the WebSocket handshake itself. This is distinct from session cookies.

- The server generates a short-lived, unique, unguessable token (anti-CSWH token) when the legitimate client page loads.
- The client JavaScript includes this token in the WebSocket handshake request (e.g., as a query parameter: `wss://yourdomain.com/ws?token=xyz123`, or in a custom HTTP header if the client is not a browser or if custom headers can be set for the WebSocket handshake).
- The server validates both the `Origin` header AND this token before upgrading the connection.
This approach provides stronger CSRF protection because an attacker from a different origin would be blocked by the `Origin` check, and an attacker leveraging XSS on a trusted origin would typically not have access to this specific, per-session/per-request token unless they can also steal it through other means.
    

3. Use wss:// (WebSocket over TLS):

Always use the wss:// URI scheme for WebSocket connections in production. This encrypts the data in transit using TLS, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks on the network path.5 While wss:// does not prevent CSWH if Origin validation is missing, it is a fundamental security requirement for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of WebSocket communications.

4. Principle of Least Privilege:

Ensure that the established WebSocket connection operates with the minimum necessary privileges. If different users or roles have different levels of access, these authorization checks should be enforced for messages received over the WebSocket, not just at the handshake stage.10

5. Input Validation on Messages:

Treat all data received over WebSocket connections (from client to server and server to client) as untrusted. Implement robust validation and sanitization routines to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS if messages are rendered in a browser, SQL injection if messages interact with a database).8

6. Session Management Review:

Consider the session management strategy for WebSockets. Relying solely on ambient HTTP session cookies can be risky if CSWH is possible. Tying WebSocket sessions to the aforementioned handshake tokens or implementing mechanisms for re-evaluating session validity periodically over the WebSocket can enhance security.

## **13. Scope and Impact**

Scope:

The Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerability can affect any Golang application that implements WebSocket server functionality if it fails to perform adequate Origin header validation during the handshake process. This is not specific to a particular version of Golang itself but rather to how WebSocket protocols and libraries are implemented and configured within an application.

- **Affected Libraries:** Applications using popular Golang WebSocket libraries are susceptible if these libraries are misconfigured:
    - `github.com/gorilla/websocket`: If `Upgrader.CheckOrigin` is set to a permissive function.
    - `github.com/coder/websocket` (formerly `nhooyr.io/websocket`): If `AcceptOptions.InsecureSkipVerify` is `true`, or `AcceptOptions.OriginPatterns` is overly broad.
    - `golang.org/x/net/websocket`: If custom origin checking logic is missing or flawed within `websocket.Server` or `websocket.Handler` configurations.
- **Application Layer:** The vulnerability exists at the application layer, specifically within the logic that handles the HTTP to WebSocket upgrade handshake.
- **Architectural Implications:** In microservice architectures or applications with numerous distinct real-time features, the scope can be particularly wide if a common, insecure WebSocket gateway, shared library configuration, or boilerplate code is used across multiple services. A single insecure pattern can propagate, leading to multiple vulnerable endpoints.

Impact:

A successful exploitation of an Insecure WebSocket Upgrade, leading to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH), can have severe consequences. The specific impact is highly dependent on the functionalities and data exposed through the compromised WebSocket connection.

- **Data Confidentiality:** Attackers can intercept and read sensitive information transmitted to the victim user over the WebSocket. This could include private messages, personal identification information (PII), financial details, session tokens, or any other data the application sends via WebSockets.

- **Data Integrity:** Attackers can send malicious messages to the server as the victim, potentially modifying data, corrupting application state, or posting unauthorized content.

- **Session Security & Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker effectively hijacks the user's authenticated session for the scope of WebSocket interactions. This allows them to perform any action that the WebSocket interface permits on behalf of the victim, such as making purchases, changing account settings, deleting data, or interacting with other users.
    
- **Reputational Damage:** Security incidents stemming from CSWH can erode user trust and damage the organization's reputation.
- **Financial Loss:** If WebSockets are involved in financial transactions, e-commerce, or control valuable assets, direct financial losses can occur.
- **Regulatory Consequences:** Data breaches resulting from CSWH can lead to non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and subsequent fines.

The variability in impact is highlighted by real-world CVEs. For instance, CVE-2024-8201 had a medium severity (CVSS 5.4), suggesting limited data exposure or action capability. Conversely, CVE-2024-11045 demonstrated critical impact (CVSS 9.6), implying that the hijacked WebSocket could lead to significant compromise. This underscores the need for each organization to evaluate the impact based on their specific WebSocket usage.

## **14. Remediation Recommendation**

Addressing the Insecure WebSocket Upgrade vulnerability requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond a simple code fix. It involves implementing robust security controls, fostering developer awareness, and establishing ongoing verification processes.

1. **Prioritize and Implement Strict Origin Validation:** This is the most critical and immediate step.
    - **Action:** Review all WebSocket server endpoints in Golang applications. Implement or correct `Origin` header validation logic to ensure that connections are only accepted from an explicit allowlist of trusted origins.
    - **Guidance:** For `gorilla/websocket`, configure `Upgrader.CheckOrigin` with a function that performs strict validation. For `coder/websocket`, use `AcceptOptions.OriginPatterns` with specific, non-wildcard patterns and ensure `InsecureSkipVerify` is `false` (which is the default). For `golang.org/x/net/websocket` or custom implementations, ensure explicit `Origin` header checking against an allowlist before completing the handshake.
        
    - **Rationale:** This directly prevents the CSWH attack vector by ensuring the server only communicates with intended client origins.
        
2. **Implement Token-Based Handshake Authentication (Defense-in-Depth):**
    - **Action:** Introduce an anti-CSRF token mechanism for WebSocket handshakes. Generate a unique, unguessable token on the server when a legitimate client page loads, and require this token to be sent (e.g., as a query parameter or custom header) during the WebSocket upgrade request. The server must validate this token in addition to the `Origin` header.
    - **Rationale:** This provides a secondary layer of defense, particularly against scenarios where an attacker might find an XSS vulnerability on a trusted origin that could bypass `Origin`only checks.
        
3. **Enforce `wss://` (WebSocket over TLS) Universally:**
    - **Action:** Mandate the use of `wss://` for all WebSocket connections in production environments. Configure servers to only accept secure WebSocket connections.
    - **Rationale:** Encrypts data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and modification by network-level attackers. While not a direct fix for CSWH, it's a fundamental security best practice.
        
4. **Conduct Thorough Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    - **Action:** Perform targeted security audits and manual code reviews of all WebSocket handshake logic and library configurations. Pay special attention to `Origin` validation, token handling, and any custom security measures.
    - **Rationale:** Helps identify existing vulnerabilities and ensures that fixes are implemented correctly and comprehensively.
5. **Educate Developers on WebSocket Security:**
    - **Action:** Provide training and resources to development teams on WebSocket security best practices, the specifics of CSWH, the importance of `Origin` validation, and secure configurations for commonly used Golang libraries.
    - **Rationale:** Many vulnerabilities arise from misunderstandings or oversight. Educating developers is crucial for preventing future occurrences.

6. **Establish Secure Defaults and Templates:**
    - **Action:** If your organization uses boilerplate code or templates for new services involving WebSockets, ensure these include secure-by-default configurations for `Origin` validation and other security controls.
    - **Rationale:** Prevents the propagation of insecure patterns across multiple applications or services.
7. **Regularly Update Dependencies:**
    - **Action:** Keep Golang versions and all third-party libraries, including WebSocket libraries, up to date.
    - **Rationale:** While this specific vulnerability is primarily about configuration, library updates may include security improvements or patches for other potential issues.
8. **Implement Robust Logging and Monitoring:**
    - **Action:** Enhance logging to capture details of WebSocket handshake attempts, including the received `Origin` header, the result of the `Origin` validation (allowed/denied), and source IP addresses. Monitor these logs for suspicious patterns or repeated failed attempts from unexpected origins.
    - **Rationale:** Improves detection capabilities for CSWH attempts and aids in forensic investigations if an incident occurs. Addresses the common weakness of poor intrusion detection for this vulnerability.

Remediation should not be viewed as a one-time task but as part of an ongoing secure development lifecycle. This includes continuous education, periodic reviews of WebSocket implementations, and adaptation to new threat intelligence or library features.

## **15. Summary**

The "Insecure WebSocket Upgrade" vulnerability in Golang applications represents a critical lapse in security that can lead to severe consequences, most notably Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH). This vulnerability typically arises when the server-side application fails to properly validate the `Origin` header during the initial HTTP handshake that transitions the connection from HTTP to the WebSocket protocol. By neglecting this crucial check, applications inadvertently trust WebSocket connection requests from any origin, allowing an attacker to initiate connections from malicious sites within the context of a victim user's authenticated browser session.

The core issue is a misunderstanding or misapplication of the security responsibilities associated with the WebSocket protocol. While the "upgrade" to WebSockets offers persistent, full-duplex communication beneficial for real-time applications, it also necessitates a shift in security thinking from the traditional HTTP request/response model. The browser's origin-based security model still applies, and the `Origin` header is the primary mechanism by which this trust is communicated and should be enforced by the server. Failure to do so effectively bypasses CSRF-like protections for the WebSocket establishment phase.

Successful exploitation via CSWH can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users, send arbitrary messages to the server, receive sensitive data intended for the victim, and perform unauthorized actions, all under the guise of the victim's session. The impact is highly dependent on the functionality exposed through the WebSocket interface, ranging from medium to critical.

Key remediation strategies center on diligent server-side validation:

- **Strict `Origin` Header Validation:** This is paramount. Servers must check the `Origin` header against a pre-defined allowlist of trusted domains and reject requests from any other origin.
    
- **Secure Library Configuration:** Golang developers using libraries like `github.com/gorilla/websocket` or `github.com/coder/websocket` must ensure that features like `CheckOrigin` or `OriginPatterns` are configured securely, and options like `InsecureSkipVerify` are avoided in production.
    
- **Defense-in-Depth:** Employing token-based authentication for the handshake process provides an additional layer of security.
- **Encrypted Transport:** Consistent use of `wss://` (WebSocket over TLS) is essential for protecting data in transit, though it does not prevent CSWH on its own.

Ultimately, securing WebSocket connections in Golang applications requires developers to recognize that the protocol upgrade is not a passive enhancement but an active responsibility. It demands careful attention to handshake validation, secure library usage, and an understanding of the unique attack vectors that WebSockets can introduce if not properly secured.
