# Unrestricted Validator Inclusion Beyond Limits (unrestricted-validator-add) in Golang Applications

## 1. Vulnerability Title

Unrestricted Validator Inclusion Beyond Limits (unrestricted-validator-add)

## 2. Severity Rating

**Overall Severity: HighðŸŸ **

The "Unrestricted Validator Inclusion Beyond Limits" (unrestricted-validator-add) vulnerability is rated as High. This severity assessment stems from its potential to fundamentally undermine an application's input validation mechanisms, which are critical for maintaining data integrity and security. If an attacker can successfully register arbitrary, malicious, or excessively resource-intensive validators, they could bypass essential security checks, cause Denial of Service (DoS) conditions, or potentially enable further exploitation. The actual severity in a specific instance would depend on the precise implementation details and the context in which validators can be registered and utilized.

The capacity to introduce unchecked validators means that an attacker could disable or circumvent rules designed to prevent common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks or data corruption. Furthermore, the "Beyond Limits" aspect suggests that even the registration of numerous legitimate, but poorly optimized or overly complex, validators could degrade service availability.

A conceptual CVSS v3.1 breakdown illustrates the potential characteristics of this vulnerability:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Attack Vector (AV) | Network (N) |
| Attack Complexity (AC) | Low (L) |
| Privileges Required (PR) | Low (L) |
| User Interaction (UI) | None (N) |
| Scope (S) | Unchanged (U) |
| Confidentiality Impact (C) | Low (L) |
| Integrity Impact (I) | High (H) |
| Availability Impact (A) | High (H) |
| **CVSS Base Score (Conceptual)** | **8.6 (High)** |

*Note: This CVSS scoring is conceptual and would vary based on the specific exploit scenario. For instance, if validator registration requires no privileges (PR:N), the score could increase. If a malicious validator could affect components beyond the validation system (S:C), the score would also be higher.*

The severity of this vulnerability can be significantly amplified if the mechanism for loading or registering validators is itself flawed. For example, if validator definitions are loaded via an insecure deserialization process, an attacker might not even need to directly interact with a validator registration API. Instead, they could craft a malicious serialized payload that, upon deserialization, registers a harmful validator or manipulates the registration logic. This creates a chained exploit where the insecure deserialization serves as the entry point for the unrestricted validator inclusion, making the overall system more fragile.

The phrase "Beyond Limits" in the vulnerability's name also points towards a nuanced Denial of Service vector. It's not solely about an attacker injecting explicitly malicious code; it can also refer to the registration of an excessive quantity of validators or a few validators that are individually legitimate but computationally very complex. Many validation libraries, including popular Go packages like `go-playground/validator`, rely on reflection and process a series of rules for each validation cycle. Each added validator contributes to the processing overhead. An attacker who can register a large number of validators, or a few validators with, for instance, computationally expensive regular expressions or deeply nested custom logic, could overwhelm the system's resources, leading to a Denial of Service. This form of resource exhaustion targets the validation framework itself.

## 3. Description

Unrestricted Validator Inclusion Beyond Limits (unrestricted-validator-add) describes a security flaw where an application permits the addition or registration of custom or dynamic data validators without sufficient controls over their origin, characteristics, quantity, or computational complexity. This lack of robust control mechanisms opens the door for attackers to introduce validators that can subvert security checks, trigger Denial of Service (DoS) conditions by consuming excessive system resources, or, in certain contexts, execute malicious logic if the validators possess capabilities for side effects.

The core of the problem lies in the application's failure to enforce boundaries on how validators are defined and integrated. Input validation is a fundamental security pillar, designed to ensure that data entering the system conforms to expected formats, constraints, and business rules, thereby protecting against various attacks and maintaining data integrity. When the validation mechanism itself can be manipulated, it ceases to be a reliable defense and can transform into an attack vector.

This vulnerability often manifests as a flaw in how a security mechanism (input validation) is managed, rather than a direct flaw in a specific business logic component. The system's ability to control its own security policies (i.e., what constitutes valid or invalid input) becomes compromised. Consequently, a successful exploit can have far-reaching implications, potentially neutralizing a wide array of input-dependent security checks throughout the application.

The "Beyond Limits" aspect of this vulnerability is multifaceted. It not only encompasses the registration of an excessive number of validators or resource-intensive ones but can also pertain to an attacker registering validators that are syntactically correct but semantically malicious. Such validators might push the boundaries of what the validation system was designed to handle, potentially uncovering edge cases or unexpected behaviors in the validator parsing or execution engine. For instance, extremely long or complex validator definitions, even if parsable, might stress the underlying validation infrastructure, leading to crashes, performance degradation, or subtle bypasses if the parsing and execution logic contains latent flaws when subjected to extreme inputs.

## 4. Technical Description

The technical underpinnings of the unrestricted-validator-add vulnerability often involve the misuse of features provided by validation libraries or custom-built validation frameworks in Go. Popular libraries like `go-playground/validator` offer mechanisms for dynamic validator registration, such as `validate.RegisterValidation("tag_name", validatorFn)`, where `validatorFn` is a custom function conforming to the `validator.Func` type. This function typically accepts a `validator.FieldLevel` interface, which provides access to field value and metadata, and returns a boolean indicating validity.

The primary attack surface emerges when an attacker can influence the parameters of such registration callsâ€”specifically, the `tag_name` or the logic of `validatorFn`. This influence might be exerted through:

1. **Direct API Exposure:** An application might expose an API endpoint that allows users (potentially unauthenticated or insufficiently authorized) to submit new validator definitions or associate existing custom logic with new tags.
2. **Configuration Loading:** Validator rules or definitions might be loaded from external configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML), database entries, or environment variables. If an attacker can modify these sources, they can inject malicious validator definitions.
3. **Insecure Deserialization of Validator Objects:** If validator objects or their configurations are serialized and stored, and later deserialized without proper validation, an attacker could provide a crafted serialized object to register a malicious validator.

A key technical aspect is the potential for an attacker to register a custom `validator.Func` that either always returns `true` (bypassing validation) or contains logic for a Denial of Service attack. For example, a validator could include a computationally intensive loop or a regular expression prone to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) when applied to certain inputs. Since `validator.Func` receives `FieldLevel`, a malicious validator could theoretically attempt to log sensitive data accessible through this interface, though direct modification of unexported struct fields or arbitrary code execution is generally not possible through this interface alone without leveraging other vulnerabilities or the `unsafe` package.

If validator definitions allow parameters (e.g., `min=5`, `max=10` in struct tags), and these parameters are not sanitized during the registration or parsing of a dynamically added validator, an attacker might provide extreme or malformed parameter values. This could lead to unexpected behavior, bypasses (e.g., setting an excessively large `max` length), or even panics in the validator parsing logic if not handled robustly.

A fundamental technical issue is often a **trust boundary violation**. Validator registration is a privileged operation that modifies the application's security policy. If the inputs to this registration process (tag names, function logic, configuration parameters) originate from or are influenced by untrusted sources without rigorous validation and authorization, the application is essentially allowing untrusted entities to define its security rules. This is a common pattern in injection-style vulnerabilities, but in this case, it targets the validation logic itself.

Furthermore, in concurrent Go applications, if dynamic validator registration or unregistration is permitted, and the underlying data structures that store these validator definitions are not properly synchronized (e.g., protected by mutexes), race conditions could occur. This might lead to inconsistent validation states, where a validator is called after being unregistered (potentially causing a panic), a newly registered validator is not immediately available, or internal validator maps become corrupted. While mature libraries are often designed to be thread-safe for read operations (i.e., performing validation), the act of modifying the validator set (registration/unregistration) by application code in a concurrent context requires careful consideration.

## 5. Common Mistakes That Cause This

Several common mistakes in development and configuration can lead to the unrestricted-validator-add vulnerability:

1. **Allowing User-Defined Validators Without Sanitization:** The most direct mistake is taking user-supplied input (e.g., from an HTTP request, a configuration file uploaded by a user) and using it directly to define validator tags, names, or the parameters of these validators without thorough sanitization and validation of the input itself. This is a form of injection where the "payload" is a validator definition.
2. **Loading Validator Configurations from Untrusted Sources:** Applications may load validation rules from external files (JSON, YAML), databases, or environment variables. If these sources can be modified by unauthorized users, or if the loading process involves insecure deserialization, malicious validators can be introduced.
3. **Lack of Limits on Validator Registration:** Failing to impose any restrictions on the number of validators that can be registered, the complexity of their logic (e.g., regex complexity, computational steps), or the types of validators allowed can pave the way for resource exhaustion attacks (DoS).
4. **Exposing Validator Management Endpoints Insecurely:** Providing administrative API endpoints or UI sections for adding, removing, or modifying validators without robust authentication and fine-grained authorization is a critical error. Such endpoints should be restricted to highly trusted administrators.
5. **Poorly Designed Custom Validator Functions:** Custom validator functions (`validator.Func` in `go-playground/validator`) that are themselves flawed can introduce vulnerabilities. This includes validators with unintended side effects (e.g., modifying state, making external calls), those that are overly complex leading to performance issues, or those containing specific vulnerabilities like ReDoS patterns in regular expressions.
6. **Ignoring Errors from Validator Registration:** If the application code attempts to register a validator but fails to check the return status or errors from the registration function (e.g., `RegisterValidation`), it might proceed in an inconsistent state where a critical validator is believed to be active but is not.
7. **Insufficient Input Validation on Validator Parameters:** When custom validators are designed to accept parameters (e.g., a regex pattern, minimum/maximum values, a list of allowed strings), failing to validate these parameters before the validator uses them can lead to vulnerabilities. An attacker might provide a malicious regex, an excessively large range, or other inputs that break the validator's logic or cause it to consume excessive resources.

A frequent underlying issue is a flawed mental model where developers implicitly trust any data related to "configuration" or "internal setup" of validators. Validator registration might be perceived as a one-time setup or an administrative task, leading to less scrutiny of the inputs involved compared to regular user data processed by business logic. However, if this "configuration" data (e.g., a JSON file defining custom validation rules, parameters passed to an admin API for validator setup) is, in fact, attacker-controllable, it must be treated as untrusted input. This oversight can lead to vulnerabilities because the "configuration path" for validators is often less hardened than the primary "data processing path."

Another common pitfall is an over-reliance on client-side validation or a Web Application Firewall (WAF) without robust server-side controls over validator definitions. Client-side checks are easily bypassed by attackers. WAFs might not possess the contextual understanding of how a specific application dynamically registers or interprets its validators, especially if it involves a custom protocol or format. The ultimate authority for defining and enforcing validation rules must reside on the server and be shielded from tampering. If an attacker can circumvent client-side or WAF defenses and directly influence the server-side registration of validators, the application's internal defenses are effectively compromised. This highlights the necessity of defense-in-depth, particularly for meta-level controls like validator management.

## 6. Exploitation Goals

Attackers exploiting the unrestricted-validator-add vulnerability can pursue several malicious objectives, depending on the nature of the flaw and the capabilities of the validators that can be introduced:

1. **Validation Bypass:** The most common goal is to introduce a validator that is overly permissive (e.g., always returns `true`) or to disable or override existing critical validators. This allows malicious or malformed data, which would normally be rejected, to be accepted by the application, potentially leading to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or the enabling of further attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS) if the bypassed data is used in sensitive downstream operations.
2. **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    - **Resource-Intensive Validator:** An attacker can register a validator that is computationally expensive. This could involve a regular expression designed to cause ReDoS , an algorithm with high time complexity, or an infinite loop (if the validator logic allows for such constructs). When this validator is triggered by incoming data, it consumes excessive CPU or memory, potentially crashing the server or making it unresponsive to legitimate users.
    - **Excessive Validator Registration:** If there are no limits on the number of validators that can be registered, an attacker might register a huge quantity of validators. Even if each validator is simple, the cumulative overhead of processing a vast number of validation rules for each relevant request can overwhelm the validation framework and lead to DoS.
3. **Data Exfiltration (Conditional):** If custom validators can be crafted to include side effects, such as making external network calls or writing to accessible logs, an attacker might be able to exfiltrate sensitive data that the validator processes (e.g., data from other fields in the struct being validated, accessible via the `FieldLevel` interface). This is less common and highly dependent on the execution environment and permissions of the validator functions but remains a theoretical possibility.
4. **Arbitrary Code Execution (Highly Conditional):** This is generally unlikely with standard Go validation libraries through the mere act of registering a validator. However, it could become a goal if the validator registration mechanism is deeply flawed, for instance, involving insecure deserialization of validator objects that leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) , or if the language used to define validators is Turing-complete, unsandboxed, and allows interaction with the underlying system.
5. **Information Disclosure:** An attacker might craft validators that, when they fail or succeed in specific ways, cause the application to return error messages or behave in a manner that reveals internal system state, data structures, or the presence of other vulnerabilities.
6. **Privilege Escalation:** If bypassing validation allows an attacker to modify data fields that control their user permissions, roles, or access rights within the application, they could escalate their privileges. For example, making an `IsAdmin` field validate to `true` when it should be `false`.

The following table outlines common exploitation vectors and their associated attacker goals:

| Exploitation Vector | Attacker Goal(s) |
| --- | --- |
| Injecting a permissive validator (e.g., `func(fl FieldLevel) bool { return true }`) | Validation Bypass, Data Integrity Compromise, Potential Privilege Escalation |
| Injecting a resource-intensive validator (e.g., ReDoS-vulnerable regex, computationally heavy loop) | Denial of Service (CPU/Memory Exhaustion) |
| Injecting an excessive number of validators | Denial of Service (Validation Framework Overload) |
| Injecting a validator with side-effects (e.g., network call, logging sensitive parts of `FieldLevel` if possible) | Data Exfiltration (Conditional), Information Disclosure |
| Injecting a validator designed to trigger specific error paths or reveal behavior upon certain inputs | Information Disclosure (System State/Structure, other vulnerabilities) |

A sophisticated attacker might not aim for an immediate, noisy effect. Instead, they could introduce a "sleeper validator." This malicious validator would remain dormant, passing legitimate data or performing no harmful actions, until specific conditions are met or a particular type of data is processed. The validator function, having access to `FieldLevel` , can inspect the field's name, type, or value. An attacker could design it to activate its malicious payload (e.g., bypass a crucial check, exfiltrate data) only when, for example, a specific username is encountered or a transaction of a certain type is processed. This targeted approach makes the exploit harder to detect during routine testing or monitoring, as it only triggers under very specific, attacker-defined circumstances.

Furthermore, attackers could exploit this vulnerability to bypass not just data format validation but also complex business logic checks that have been implemented as custom validators. For instance, a rule like "a user's available balance must be greater than or equal to the transaction amount" might be enforced via a custom validator. If an attacker can disable this validator or introduce a more permissive one, they can directly subvert core application logic, potentially leading to unauthorized fund transfers, inventory manipulation, or other forms of fraud, depending on the application's domain. This elevates the impact beyond simple data corruption to direct compromise of business rules.

## 7. Affected Components or Files

The unrestricted-validator-add vulnerability can affect several components within a Go application's ecosystem:

1. **Input Validation Modules/Packages:** Any Go package or custom code segment responsible for managing, registering, and invoking data validators is a primary candidate. This includes wrappers or abstractions built around standard libraries like `go-playground/validator`.
2. **Dynamic Configuration Loaders:** Systems or code paths that load validator rules or allow validator registration based on external configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML, TOML), database entries, or environment variables are key areas of concern. If these loaders do not securely parse and validate the configuration data, they can become a vector for injecting malicious validators.
3. **Administrative Interfaces/APIs for Validator Management:** If an application provides web interfaces or API endpoints for administrators (or other users) to define, upload, or modify custom validation rules, these interfaces are directly affected if they lack strong authentication, authorization, and input sanitization for the validator definitions themselves.
4. **Libraries like `go-playground/validator`:** While the library itself is a tool and not inherently vulnerable, its features designed for flexibility, such as `RegisterValidation` , become the focal point of misuse if they can be invoked with untrusted or attacker-controlled input for tag names or validator functions.
5. **Application Code Directly Invoking Registration Functions:** Specific Go files containing application logic that calls functions like `RegisterValidation` with data derived from HTTP requests, configuration files, user inputs, or other potentially untrusted sources are directly implicated.
6. **Plugin or Extension Systems:** Applications that support plugins or dynamically loaded modules, where these extensions can register their own validators, are at risk if the plugin loading and registration mechanism is not secure.

In microservice architectures, if validation rules are managed by a centralized configuration service and then propagated to individual microservices, this central service becomes a critical component. A compromise of this central validator configuration mechanism, or an insecure method of distributing these rules, could lead to the widespread deployment of malicious or faulty validators across multiple services, significantly amplifying the blast radius of the vulnerability.

Similarly, systems employing a plugin architecture, where plugins can extend functionality including adding custom data types and their associated validators, present another area of concern. If an attacker can introduce a malicious plugin into the system (perhaps through a separate vulnerability or a weak plugin vetting process), that plugin could then leverage legitimate validator registration APIs to inject harmful validation logic into the application. In such scenarios, the attack vector shifts from directly targeting the validator registration to compromising the plugin management system itself.

## 8. Vulnerable Code Snippet

The following conceptual Go code snippet illustrates how an unrestricted validator inclusion vulnerability might manifest, particularly using the `go-playground/validator` library.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"math" // Used for a placeholder in a DoS example
	"net/http"

	"github.com/go-playground/validator/v10"
)

var validate *validator.Validate

// User struct for demonstration
type User struct {
	Username    string `validate:"required,min=3"`
	Email       string `validate:"required,email"`
	Permissions string `validate:"user_perms_check"` // This tag will be targeted
}

// This is a legitimate validator that might be pre-registered
func checkUserPermissions(fl validator.FieldLevel) bool {
	// In a real app, this would check against a list of valid permissions
	return fl.Field().String() == "user" |
| fl.Field().String() == "guest"
}

// HTTP handler that insecurely allows registration of custom validators
// An attacker could target this endpoint if it's exposed without proper controls.
func insecureRegisterValidatorHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	tag := r.URL.Query().Get("tag")
	logicType := r.URL.Query().Get("logic_type") // e.g., "allow_all", "dos_regex"

	if tag == "" |
| logicType == "" {
		http.Error(w, "Query parameters 'tag' and 'logic_type' are required", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	var newValidatorFunc validator.Func
	var message string

	switch logicType {
	case "allow_all":
		// Attacker registers a validator that always returns true

			// Simulate extremely heavy computation
			for i := 0; i < 200000000; i++ { // Increased loop for noticeable delay
				_ = math.Sin(float64(i)) * math.Cos(float64(i))
			}

			return true // Outcome doesn't matter for DoS
		}
		message = fmt.Sprintf("Validator '%s' registered with 'dos_compute' logic.", tag)

	default:
		http.Error(w, "Unknown 'logic_type'", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	// THE VULNERABLE STEP: Registering a validator where 'tag' and 'newValidatorFunc'
	// are derived from potentially untrusted HTTP request parameters without sufficient checks or authorization.
	err := validate.RegisterValidation(tag, newValidatorFunc)
	if err!= nil {
		http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Failed to register validator: %s", err.Error()), http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}

	fmt.Fprintln(w, message)
	fmt.Printf("INFO: %s\n", message)
}

// Handler to test validation on a User object
func processUserHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// In a real app, user data would come from r.Body
	// For PoC, we use a fixed user struct.
	// If an attacker registered a malicious validator for 'user_perms_check',
	// they could give invalid permissions.
	testUser := User{
		Username:    "attacker",
		Email:       "attacker@example.com",
		Permissions: "admin_exploit", // This would normally fail 'checkUserPermissions'
	}

	err := validate.Struct(testUser)
	if err!= nil {
		errMsg := fmt.Sprintf("Validation failed for user '%s': %v", testUser.Username, err)
		http.Error(w, errMsg, http.StatusBadRequest)
		fmt.Printf("VALIDATION: %s\n", errMsg)
		return
	}

	successMsg := fmt.Sprintf("Validation successful for user '%s' (Permissions: '%s')", testUser.Username, testUser.Permissions)
	fmt.Fprintln(w, successMsg)

	if err!= nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to register initial validator: %v", err)
	}
	fmt.Println("INFO: Legitimate 'user_perms_check' validator registered.")

	// Expose the insecure registration endpoint
	http.HandleFunc("/registerValidator", insecureRegisterValidatorHandler)
	// Expose an endpoint to test the validation
	http.HandleFunc("/processUser", processUserHandler)

	fmt.Println("Server starting on :8080...")
	fmt.Println("To test bypass: curl \"http://localhost:8080/registerValidator?tag=user_perms_check&logic_type=allow_all\"")
	fmt.Println("Then: curl http://localhost:8080/processUser")
	fmt.Println("To test DoS: curl \"http://localhost:8080/registerValidator?tag=user_perms_check&logic_type=dos_compute\"")
	fmt.Println("Then: curl http://localhost:8080/processUser (expect delay or timeout)")

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

**Explanation of the Snippet:**

1. A `User` struct is defined with a `Permissions` field that uses the `user_perms_check` validation tag.
2. Initially, `user_perms_check` is registered with a legitimate validator `checkUserPermissions` which only allows "user" or "guest".
3. The `insecureRegisterValidatorHandler` HTTP handler allows anyone to re-register a validator for any given `tag` (e.g., `user_perms_check`) with a chosen `logic_type`.
    - If `logic_type=allow_all`, it registers a function that always returns `true`.
    - If `logic_type=dos_compute`, it registers a function that performs a CPU-intensive loop.
4. An attacker can first call `/registerValidator?tag=user_perms_check&logic_type=allow_all`. This overwrites the legitimate `user_perms_check` validator with one that always passes.
5. Subsequently, when `/processUser` is called, the `User` struct containing `Permissions: "admin_exploit"` (which would normally fail) will now pass validation because the `user_perms_check` tag resolves to the attacker's "allow_all" validator. This demonstrates validation bypass.
6. Alternatively, if the attacker calls `/registerValidator?tag=user_perms_check&logic_type=dos_compute`, then calls to `/processUser` will trigger the CPU-intensive validator, leading to a Denial of Service.

The vulnerability lies in the `insecureRegisterValidatorHandler` allowing unauthenticated and unchecked re-registration of validators, particularly the `validate.RegisterValidation(tag, newValidatorFunc)` call where both `tag` and `newValidatorFunc` are derived from attacker-controlled HTTP parameters. This "glue code" which exposes the library's dynamic features without adequate safeguards is the typical locus of the vulnerability, rather than the validator library itself.

## 9. Detection Steps

Detecting the unrestricted-validator-add vulnerability requires a combination of static analysis, dynamic analysis, and manual code review.

**Static Analysis (SAST):**

- Identify all calls to validator registration functions within the codebase. For `go-playground/validator`, this would primarily be `validate.RegisterValidation()`.
- Trace the data flow for arguments passed to these registration functions, specifically the tag name and the validator function itself (or any parameters used to construct/select it). If these arguments can be influenced by external inputsâ€”such as HTTP request parameters, data from files, database entries, or environment variablesâ€”without proper sanitization, authorization, or whitelisting, this should be flagged as a potential vulnerability. SAST tools may need to be configured with custom rules to recognize validator registration functions as sensitive sinks.
- Examine struct definitions for validation tags. If these tags are dynamically generated or derived from constants that could be influenced by insecure build-time configurations or less-vetted sources, it warrants investigation.
- Scan for the use of insecure deserialization patterns (e.g., `encoding/gob`, `encoding/xml`, or unsafe `encoding/json` usage) when loading validator configurations or objects that might subsequently register validators.

**Dynamic Analysis (DAST):**

- If the application exposes any interface (API, admin panel) for managing or registering validators, attempt to interact with it.
- **Bypass Attempts:** Try to register overly permissive validators. For example, if custom regex validators can be defined, submit a regex like `.*`. If custom functions can be selected or defined, attempt to register one that always returns `true`. Then, test if this new validator can be applied to critical fields to bypass existing checks.
- **Resource Exhaustion Attempts:** Attempt to register validators known to be resource-intensive. This includes:
    - Regular expressions vulnerable to ReDoS (e.g., those with nested quantifiers or problematic alternations).
    - Validators that might involve very complex computations or loops based on input length.
    - Attempt to register an unusually large number of validators if the interface allows it.
    - Monitor server performance (CPU, memory, response times) during these tests. Significant degradation or unresponsiveness indicates a potential DoS vulnerability. This may require integrating DAST tools with backend performance monitoring capabilities.
- **Fuzzing:** Fuzz validator registration endpoints with a wide range of inputs for tag names, validator definitions, and any associated parameters to uncover parsing errors, unexpected behavior, or crashes.

**Manual Code Review:**

- Pay close attention to any modules or functions that handle the dynamic definition, loading, or registration of validation rules.
- Scrutinize the parsing and handling of validator configurations, especially if they are loaded from external sources or involve complex data structures that might be deserialized.
- Review the logic of all custom validator functions (`validator.Func` or similar). Look for:
    - Potential side effects (e.g., external network calls, file I/O, modification of global state).
    - Inefficient algorithms or complex regular expressions that could lead to performance issues or ReDoS.
    - Improper error handling within the custom validator.
    - Reliance on global state that could be manipulated.
- Verify that any administrative interfaces or APIs for validator management are protected by strong, multi-layered authentication and fine-grained authorization, ensuring only highly trusted administrators can modify validation rules.
- Assess the security of how validator tags are associated with struct fields. If tags can be dynamically assigned or if structs can be dynamically generated based on external schemas, this is a high-risk area.

**Dependency Analysis:**

- While this vulnerability is often about the misuse of library features rather than a flaw in the library itself, keep validation libraries and their dependencies updated. Check for any known CVEs related to the specific validation libraries in use, as these could exacerbate or simplify the exploitation of an unrestricted-validator-add condition.

Effective detection often requires understanding that validator registration functions act as "meta-sinks." They don't directly execute a traditionally dangerous operation (like an SQL query) with the tainted input, but they configure a future operation (running a potentially compromised validator) that can be dangerous. SAST tools may need specific awareness of these meta-sinks.

## 10. Proof of Concept (PoC)

This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker might exploit an unrestricted validator inclusion vulnerability. It assumes an application uses `go-playground/validator` and has an insecurely exposed HTTP endpoint that allows dynamic registration of validators.

**Scenario:**
The target application has an endpoint `/api/admin/register-custom-validator` which is intended for administrators to add new validation rules. However, due to a misconfiguration, this endpoint is accessible without proper authentication or lacks sufficient validation on the inputs defining the new validator. The application validates a `Transaction` struct, which includes a `Details` field.

**Attacker's Goals:**

1. Bypass validation for the `Transaction.Details` field to inject disallowed content.
2. Cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by registering a resource-intensive validator.

**Vulnerable Application Structure (Conceptual):**

- A `Transaction` struct:
    
    ```go
    type Transaction struct {
        Amount  float64 `validate:"gt=0"`
        Details string  `validate:"required,transaction_details_check"` // Target tag
        UserID  string  `validate:"required,uuid"`
    }
    ```
    
- An HTTP handler at `/api/submit-transaction` that accepts JSON, deserializes it into a `Transaction` object, and validates it using `validate.Struct(transaction)`.
- An HTTP handler at `/api/admin/register-custom-validator` that accepts `tag_name` and `logic_identifier` (e.g., "allow_all", "complex_pattern_match_dos") as query parameters. This handler calls `validate.RegisterValidation(tag_name, selected_logic_func)`.

**PoC Steps:**

**Part 1: Validation Bypass**

1. **Reconnaissance:** The attacker discovers the `/api/admin/register-custom-validator` endpoint and learns it accepts `tag_name` and `logic_identifier`. They also know or infer that transactions use a tag like `transaction_details_check` for the `Details` field.
2. **Exploitation - Registering a Permissive Validator:**
The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to register an "allow-all" validator for the `transaction_details_check` tag:BashGo
    
    `curl -X POST "http://target-app.com/api/admin/register-custom-validator?tag_name=transaction_details_check&logic_identifier=allow_all"`
    
    The server-side code for `logic_identifier="allow_all"` would register a `validator.Func` similar to:
    
    `func(fl validator.FieldLevel) bool { return true }`
    
    This effectively makes any input for fields tagged with `transaction_details_check` valid.
    
3. **Submitting Malicious Data:**
The attacker now submits a transaction with normally disallowed content in the `Details` field:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://target-app.com/api/submit-transaction \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
               "Amount": 100.00,
               "Details": "<script>alert(\"XSS Attempt via Bypassed Validation\")</script>",
               "UserID": "some-valid-uuid"
             }'
    ```
    
    If the original `transaction_details_check` validator was meant to sanitize or reject HTML/script tags, the new "allow-all" validator bypasses this. The malicious script might be stored and later rendered, leading to XSS, or other forms of data corruption might occur.
    

**Part 2: Denial of Service**

1. **Reconnaissance:** Same as above.
2. **Exploitation - Registering a Resource-Intensive Validator:**
The attacker sends a request to register a validator that uses a ReDoS-vulnerable regex or a computationally heavy loop for the `transaction_details_check` tag:Bash
    
    `curl -X POST "http://target-app.com/api/admin/register-custom-validator?tag_name=transaction_details_check&logic_identifier=complex_pattern_match_dos"`
    
    The server-side code for `logic_identifier="complex_pattern_match_dos"` might register a `validator.Func` containing a ReDoS pattern like `^(\w+\s?)*$`  or a heavy loop as shown in Section 8's code snippet.
    
3. **Triggering DoS:**
The attacker submits a transaction with a long string in the `Details` field designed to trigger the worst-case behavior of the ReDoS regex or the heavy computation:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://target-app.com/api/submit-transaction \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
               "Amount": 50.00,
               "Details": "word word word... (very long string)... word!",
               "UserID": "another-valid-uuid"
             }'
    ```
    
    When the application attempts to validate this transaction, the malicious validator for `Details` consumes excessive CPU resources, potentially hanging the request-processing goroutine or even the entire application, leading to a DoS for other users.
    

The success of such a PoC often depends on a secondary condition: the attacker's ability to either control which validator tag is applied to a field (less common) or, more likely, to register a validator for a tag that is already actively used by a critical field in the application's data structures. Simply registering a new, unused malicious tag (`e.g., malicious_new_tag`) would have no immediate impact unless the attacker can also coerce the application into using that tag for validating some input. Thus, the ability to overwrite or redefine existing, in-use validator tags is a more potent exploitation path.

## 11. Risk Classification

The unrestricted-validator-add vulnerability can be classified using several Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), reflecting its multifaceted nature:

- **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:** This is the most direct and encompassing CWE. The vulnerability arises because the input used to define or register validators (which are themselves part of the input validation mechanism) is not properly validated or controlled. This allows the validation logic to be subverted.
- **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** This applies when attackers can register validators that are computationally expensive (e.g., ReDoS-vulnerable regular expressions, inefficient algorithms) or when they can register an excessive number of validators. Both scenarios can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting CPU, memory, or other system resources when these validators are invoked.
- **CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('Injection'):** This CWE could be relevant in highly specific and less common scenarios. If the custom validator functions registered by an attacker have the capability to construct and execute OS commands, or to generate code in another interpreted language (e.g., constructing a script string that is then executed), and the inputs to these functions (derived from the validated field or validator parameters) are not properly neutralized, it could lead to command injection or similar injection attacks. This is generally not a direct risk with standard Go validation libraries but depends heavily on the power granted to custom validator logic and its interaction with the host system.
- **CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure:** Input validation is a critical protection mechanism. This vulnerability causes that mechanism to fail or be compromised, rendering it ineffective or, worse, turning it into an attack vector.
- **CWE-284: Improper Access Control:** If the mechanism for registering validators (e.g., an API endpoint) lacks proper access control, allowing unauthorized users to define or modify validation rules, this CWE is applicable.

**Likelihood:** Medium to High. The likelihood depends on how easily an attacker can influence the validator registration process. If it's via an unauthenticated or poorly secured API, or through easily modifiable configuration files, the likelihood is High. If it requires chaining with other vulnerabilities or exploiting subtle flaws in configuration parsing, it might be Medium.

**Impact:** High. A successful exploit can lead to a complete bypass of input validation checks, resulting in data integrity compromise, unauthorized actions, or privilege escalation. DoS is also a significant impact. If the bypass enables further attacks like SQL injection or XSS, the overall impact can be critical.

This vulnerability can act as a "gateway" or an enabler for other types of vulnerabilities. Input validation is a primary defense against a wide range of attacks, including common injection flaws like SQL Injection (CWE-89) and Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79). If an attacker leverages "unrestricted-validator-add" to neutralize or bypass the validation for a specific input field (e.g., by registering an "allow-all" validator for it), then subsequent malicious input (such as an SQL injection payload or an XSS script) sent to that field will pass the compromised validation stage. If this unvalidated, malicious input is then used in a sensitive downstream operation (e.g., incorporated into a database query or rendered on a web page), the secondary vulnerability (SQLi or XSS) will be triggered. In this manner, "unrestricted-validator-add" dismantles a key defense layer, paving the way for other attacks that would have otherwise been blocked.

## 12. Fix & Patch Guidance

Addressing the unrestricted-validator-add vulnerability requires a multi-layered approach focusing on restricting how validators are defined and managed, ensuring the security of custom validator logic, and implementing resource controls.

1. **Strictly Control Validator Registration:**
    - **Avoid Dynamic Registration from Untrusted Sources:** As a primary rule, do not allow dynamic registration of validators where the tag name, the validator logic, or its parameters are derived from untrusted user input (e.g., HTTP request parameters, user-uploaded files).
    - **Whitelist Approved Validators:** If dynamic registration is an essential feature (e.g., selecting from a set of predefined validators at runtime), use a strict whitelist of approved validator tags and their corresponding predefined, secure validator functions. Do not allow the registration of arbitrary code or tags not on this list.
    - **Secure Management Endpoints:** Any API endpoints or administrative interfaces used for managing validators (adding, modifying, deleting) must be protected with strong authentication and fine-grained authorization, restricted to only highly trusted administrators.
2. **Sanitize and Validate Validator Definitions:**
    - If validator configurations must be loaded from external sources (e.g., configuration files, database entries), these configurations must be treated as potentially untrusted input. Rigorously validate their structure, syntax, and content before parsing and applying them. This includes checking for known malicious patterns, overly complex expressions, or disallowed parameters.
    - Essentially, treat validator definitions sourced externally with the same scrutiny as executable code.
3. **Implement Resource Limiting for Validators:**
    - **Execution Timeouts:** If possible, implement timeouts for the execution of individual validator functions or the overall validation process for a given struct/object. This can help mitigate DoS from validators that enter long loops or perform unexpectedly slow operations.
    - **Complexity Limits:** For validators that accept parameters defining complexity (e.g., regular expressions, depth of recursion for nested validations), enforce strict limits on this complexity. For regexes, consider using libraries designed to prevent ReDoS, such as Google's RE2, or implement robust complexity analysis before accepting a regex.
    - **Quantity Limits:** Impose a reasonable limit on the total number of custom validators that can be registered or active in the system to prevent framework overload.
4. **Principle of Least Privilege for Custom Validators:**
    - Custom validator functions should be designed to have minimal privileges. They should ideally be pure functions, operating only on the provided field data without side effects like network calls, file system access, or modification of global state, unless absolutely necessary and heavily scrutinized.
5. **Secure Custom Validator Functions:**
    - **No Side Effects:** Validator functions should primarily focus on returning a boolean based on the input field's value and context. Avoid any operations that modify state outside the validator's scope.
    - **Efficiency and ReDoS Prevention:** Ensure custom validators are written efficiently. If they involve regular expressions, these must be carefully crafted to avoid ReDoS vulnerabilities. Test them against known ReDoS patterns and malicious inputs.
    - **Graceful Error Handling:** Custom validators should handle any internal errors gracefully and not panic or leak sensitive information in error messages.
    - **Avoid `unsafe` Package:** Custom validator functions should not use the `unsafe` package.
6. **Utilize Library-Specific Best Practices:**
    - For libraries like `go-playground/validator`, adopt recommended practices. For instance, initializing with `validator.New(validator.WithRequiredStructEnabled())` is advised, as this option enables stricter behavior that is planned to become the default, potentially helping to catch certain misconfigurations or problematic validation logic earlier.
7. **Regular Code Reviews and Security Testing:**
    - Conduct thorough code reviews specifically targeting any code involved in validator registration, management, and the implementation of custom validator functions.
    - Perform security testing (SAST, DAST, penetration testing) focused on identifying pathways for influencing validator definitions and testing the resilience of custom validators against bypass and DoS attempts.

A robust approach involves establishing a secure "validator lifecycle management" process. This means that any new custom validator, even if intended for legitimate purposes, should undergo a review process similar to that for any other piece of application code. This review should assess its correctness, performance implications, and security posture before it's approved and deployed. Monitoring the performance impact of validators in a production environment can also help in proactively identifying problematic validators that might be causing resource drain.

Consider implementing a "deny-by-default, allow-by-exception" model for the application of validator tags to struct fields. Even if an attacker manages to register a malicious validator (e.g., `malicious_tag`), its impact is nullified if that tag cannot be applied to any sensitive field. An application could maintain a policy or mapping that explicitly defines which validator tags are permissible for which struct types or specific fields. This adds an additional layer of defense: compromise of the registration mechanism does not automatically lead to compromise of data validation if the application of the malicious validator is also restricted. This introduces a form of context-aware validation control.

## 13. Scope and Impact

**Scope:**

The unrestricted-validator-add vulnerability can potentially affect any Go application that incorporates features for dynamic or custom validator registration, particularly if the definitions or triggers for these registrations can be influenced by external input or configurations. The scope includes:

- Applications using libraries like `go-playground/validator` and exposing its dynamic registration capabilities (e.g., `RegisterValidation`) without adequate safeguards.
- Systems with plugin architectures where plugins can define and register their own validation rules. If the plugin loading or registration process is not secure, malicious plugins could introduce harmful validators.
- Multi-tenant platforms where tenants might have some capability to define or customize validation rules for their own data. An insecure implementation could allow one tenant to affect others or the platform itself.
- Applications that load complex validation logic or rules from external configuration files (JSON, YAML, etc.) or databases, especially if these sources are not adequately protected or if the parsing of these configurations is vulnerable.
- The scope can range from being localized within a single module of an application to being widespread if the validator management system is centralized but implemented insecurely, affecting all parts of the application that rely on it.

**Impact:**

The successful exploitation of unrestricted-validator-add can have severe consequences:

1. **Data Integrity Loss:** If attackers bypass validation, they can inject malformed, inconsistent, or malicious data into the system. This can lead to corrupted databases, incorrect application behavior, flawed business logic execution, and erroneous reporting or decision-making based on tainted data.
2. **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can register validators that are computationally intensive (e.g., using ReDoS-vulnerable regexes, performing complex calculations in loops) or register an excessive number of validators. When these validators are triggered, they can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory), causing the application to become unresponsive, slow down significantly, or crash entirely.
3. **Security Control Bypass:** Input validation often serves as a first line of defense. Bypassing it can disable critical security checks, including those related to authentication (e.g., format of tokens), authorization (e.g., allowed values for role fields), or business rules implemented as validators (e.g., transaction limits).
4. **Information Disclosure:** Malformed or specially crafted validators might cause the system to produce error messages that leak sensitive information about the system's internal state, data structures, or other vulnerabilities. In rare cases, if validators can have side effects like logging to attacker-accessible locations, they might directly exfiltrate processed data.
5. **Potential for Further Exploitation:** If the bypassed validation was intended to prevent other types of attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection, Path Traversal), then successfully bypassing these checks opens the door for those subsequent attacks. The unrestricted-validator-add then acts as an enabler.
6. **Reputational Damage and Financial Loss:** Consequences of data breaches, system downtime due to DoS, fraudulent transactions facilitated by bypassed business rules, or loss of customer trust can lead to significant reputational and financial damage.

The impact is notably amplified in systems where validation rules are shared, inherited, or centrally managed. For instance, if a base Data Transfer Object (DTO) uses a common validation tag, and the validator associated with that tag is compromised, all parts of the application using that DTO or inheriting from it are affected. In multi-tenant environments, a compromised global validator or a flaw in how tenant-specific validators are isolated could impact multiple tenants or the entire platform.

Furthermore, the impact of bypassed validation isn't always immediate or obvious like a system crash. Long-term, subtle data corruption can occur if validators are bypassed to allow slightly malformed but not system-breaking data (e.g., incorrect status codes, slightly off numerical values, non-standard characters in text fields). This "low and slow" data degradation can accumulate over time, leading to complex and hard-to-diagnose bugs, inaccurate analytics, data reconciliation nightmares, and significant challenges during data migrations or system upgrades. This insidious form of impact can sometimes be more damaging in the long run than a conspicuous DoS attack because it may go undetected for extended periods.

## 14. Remediation Recommendation

Effective remediation for the unrestricted-validator-add vulnerability requires a defense-in-depth strategy that encompasses strict controls over validator definition and registration, secure implementation of custom validators, resource management, and robust access controls.

1. **Adopt a "Secure by Default" Stance for Validators:**
    - Treat validator definitions as sensitive code or highly privileged configuration.
    - By default, disallow any dynamic registration of validators from untrusted or external sources. Validator definitions should ideally be part of the compiled application code and subject to the same review and testing processes.
2. **Centralized and Vetted Validator Repository:**
    - If custom validators are essential for the application's flexibility, maintain them in a controlled, internal code repository or a well-defined library.
    - All additions or modifications to this repository of custom validators must undergo rigorous security review and testing before deployment.
3. **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation for Validator Configurations:**
    - If validator parameters or definitions are loaded from configuration files, databases, or other external sources, these inputs must be meticulously validated and sanitized before being used to instantiate or register validators.
    - Define a strict schema for validator configurations and reject any configuration that does not conform. Be wary of deserializing complex objects for validator definitions without ensuring the source is trusted and the data is verified.
4. **Use Whitelists for Dynamic Validators:**
    - If runtime selection or registration of validators is an unavoidable requirement, implement a strict whitelist of pre-approved, thoroughly vetted validator functions or tags. The application should only allow registration or use of validators from this explicit allowlist, rather than permitting the definition or registration of arbitrary functions or tags.
5. **Implement Resource Controls for Validator Execution:**
    - **Execution Timeouts:** Where feasible, enforce execution timeouts for individual validation operations or for the validation of an entire data structure. This helps mitigate DoS from overly complex or looping validators.
    - **Complexity Monitoring and Limits:** For validators that involve potentially complex operations like regular expressions, use libraries or techniques to analyze and limit their complexity (e.g., using Google's RE2 library for regex, which is designed to offer linear time matching and prevent ReDoS).
    - **Quantity Caps:** Limit the maximum number of custom or dynamic validators that can be registered or active at any given time to prevent overwhelming the validation framework.
6. **Strong Authentication and Authorization for Validator Management:**
    - Any interface (API, UI, CLI tool) that allows the creation, modification, or deletion of validators must be protected by robust, multi-factor authentication and fine-grained authorization. Access should be restricted to the minimum necessary set of highly trusted administrators.
7. **Regular Security Audits and Testing:**
    - Periodically conduct security audits and code reviews focusing specifically on validator management logic, custom validator implementations, and any configuration loading mechanisms related to validation.
    - Incorporate test cases into security testing (DAST, penetration tests) that attempt to exploit potential unrestricted validator inclusion flaws.
8. **Security Awareness and Training for Developers:**
    - Educate developers about the risks associated with dynamic features like validator registration and the importance of treating validator definitions as sensitive input that requires rigorous validation and control. Emphasize that validation logic is part of the application's security boundary.

The following table compares various remediation strategies:

| Remediation Strategy | Pros | Cons | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Disable All Dynamic Validator Registration** | Highest security against this specific vector. Simpler to manage. | Reduced runtime flexibility. | Most applications that do not have a strong business need for it. |
| **Whitelist of Predefined, Vetted Validators** | Good security; allows controlled flexibility. | Requires upfront definition and vetting of all allowed validators. | Systems needing some dynamic choice from a known-safe set of validators. |
| **Strict Input Sanitization for Validator Configuration** | Maintains some dynamism if config must be external. | Complex to implement correctly; high risk of sanitization bypass if flawed. | When config must be external but can be strictly validated against a schema. |
| **Resource Limiting (Timeouts, Complexity Checks)** | Mitigates DoS impact. Defense-in-depth. | Does not prevent validation logic bypass. May be hard to tune correctly. | All systems, as an essential defense-in-depth measure. |
| **Strong AuthN/AuthZ on Management Interfaces** | Protects administrative functions from unauthorized access. | Does not protect against a compromised administrator account. | All systems that provide any interface for validator management. |

For applications that have an absolute requirement to allow powerful, near-arbitrary custom validators (e.g., a highly customizable SaaS platform where customers can define complex validation rules for their data), simpler remediation strategies like whitelisting or basic sanitization might prove insufficient. In such advanced scenarios, architectural changes to isolate the validator registration and execution environment should be considered. This could involve sandboxing techniques, such as running user-defined validators in a separate, resource-constrained process with restricted permissions, using a safe, embedded scripting language with limited capabilities for validator definitions, or applying strict quotas (CPU, memory, network access, execution time) to the validation execution context. This is a more complex approach but offers stronger security guarantees when dealing with validator logic sourced from less trusted environments.

Another advanced remediation technique is to implement "validator profiles" or "security levels" for validator registration. Under this model, different sources of validator definitions or different users attempting to register validators would be assigned varying levels of trust and corresponding permissions. For example, validators defined directly in the compiled application code would be fully trusted. Validators originating from a configuration managed by a core administrative team might also have high trust. However, validators influenced by individual user settings or less trusted external systems would be assigned a very low trust level and restricted to a very small, predefined, and inherently safe subset of validation types and complexities. This allows for more granular control over the power and potential risk associated with dynamically registered validators.

## 15. Summary

Unrestricted Validator Inclusion Beyond Limits (unrestricted-validator-add) is a significant security vulnerability in Go applications that arises when the mechanisms for adding or registering custom or dynamic data validators lack adequate controls. This deficiency allows attackers to manipulate an application's data validation processes, potentially by introducing validators that bypass security checks, consume excessive system resources leading to Denial of Service (DoS), or, in some cases, execute unintended logic.

The key risks associated with this vulnerability are severe and multifaceted. They include the complete bypass of input validation, leading to data corruption or enabling further attacks like SQL injection or XSS. Resource exhaustion, often through ReDoS attacks via malicious regular expressions or by registering an overwhelming number of validators, can render the application unavailable. Information disclosure through crafted error messages or even data exfiltration (if validators have side effects) are also potential outcomes.

The core cause of unrestricted-validator-add is typically insufficient control, sanitization, and authorization around the inputs used to define, configure, or register these dynamic validators. Essentially, the application may inadvertently allow untrusted data or unauthorized actors to dictate parts of its own security policy. This often stems from insecurely exposed API endpoints for validator management, unsafe loading of validator configurations from modifiable external sources, or a failure to limit the quantity and complexity of registrable validators.

Critical mitigation strategies revolve around establishing strict controls over the entire lifecycle of validators. This includes:

- Treating validator definitions as sensitive code and avoiding dynamic registration from untrusted sources.
- Implementing robust authentication and authorization for any validator management interfaces.
- Thoroughly validating and sanitizing any external configurations that define validator behavior.
- Enforcing resource limits (e.g., execution time, complexity, quantity) for validators.
- Ensuring custom validator functions are secure, efficient, and free of side effects.

This vulnerability underscores a fundamental security principle: mechanisms designed to protect an application, such as input validation, must themselves be implemented and managed securely. If the system for configuring or extending a security control is flawed, that control can fail or, worse, become an attack surface itself. Therefore, the design and implementation of how security features like data validation are managed are as critical to overall application security as the features themselves. A defense-in-depth approach, combining secure coding practices, strict access controls, and continuous monitoring, is crucial for mitigating the risks posed by unrestricted validator inclusion.
