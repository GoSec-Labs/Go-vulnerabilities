# **Analysis of Broken Caching Headers Vulnerability in Golang Applications**

## **1. Vulnerability Title**

Broken Caching Headers (Improper Cache Control Configuration)

## **2. Severity Rating**

**MediumðŸŸ¡ to HighðŸŸ **

**Rationale:** The severity depends heavily on the sensitivity of the data being improperly cached. Exposure of non-sensitive public data might be Low risk, while caching of session identifiers, personal user data, or financial information can lead to High-severity impacts like account takeover or sensitive data disclosure. Cache poisoning attacks targeting CDNs can also lead to High severity due to widespread impact on availability or integrity.

## **3. Description**

Broken Caching Headers refer to vulnerabilities arising from the improper configuration of HTTP caching headers, primarily `Cache-Control`, `Pragma`, `Expires`, `ETag`, and `Last-Modified`. When web applications, including those built with Golang, fail to set these headers correctly for responses containing sensitive information, they instruct browsers and intermediate caching proxies (like CDNs or corporate proxies) to store local copies of this data. This can lead to sensitive information being exposed to unauthorized users, persisting after logout, or being served stale, potentially leading to incorrect application behavior or data disclosure.

## **4. Technical Description**

HTTP caching is designed to improve performance by storing responses locally, reducing latency and server load. This behavior is governed by specific HTTP response headers sent by the server.

- **`Cache-Control`:** This is the primary header for specifying caching policies in HTTP/1.1. Key directives include :

    - `no-store`: Prevents the response from being stored in any cache. This is the most effective way to prevent caching of sensitive data.
    - `no-cache`: Requires the cache to revalidate with the origin server before using a cached response. It does *not* prevent storage but ensures freshness.
    - `private`: Indicates the response is user-specific and should only be stored by the end-user's browser cache, not shared caches (like CDNs).
    - `public`: Allows the response to be stored by any cache.
    - `max-age=<seconds>`: Specifies the maximum time a response is considered fresh.
    - `must-revalidate`: Tells caches they must revalidate once the response becomes stale; stale responses cannot be served.

- **`Pragma: no-cache`:** An older HTTP/1.0 header sometimes used for backward compatibility, generally superseded by `Cache-Control`.
- **`Expires`:** An older HTTP/1.0 header specifying an absolute date/time after which the response is stale. `Cache-Control: max-age` is preferred.
- **`ETag` (Entity Tag):** An identifier for a specific version of a resource, often a hash of the content. Used for conditional requests (with `If-None-Match`) to check if the resource has changed, potentially avoiding re-downloading if the ETag matches.
    
- **`Last-Modified`:** A timestamp indicating when the resource was last modified. Used for conditional requests (with `If-Modified-Since`) similarly to `ETag`.

A "Broken Caching Headers" vulnerability occurs when these headers are missing or configured insecurely for responses containing sensitive data. For instance, omitting caching headers or setting `Cache-Control: public` or a long `max-age` on a page displaying personal account details allows that page to be cached. If a user accesses this page on a shared computer or via a shared proxy, subsequent users or attackers might retrieve the cached sensitive data. Golang's standard `net/http` library provides mechanisms to set these headers via `http.ResponseWriter.Header().Set()`. However, developers must explicitly configure appropriate caching policies based on the sensitivity of the data in each response. Furthermore, complexities arise with how Go's `net/http` package handles headers during errors (e.g., via `http.Error` or `http.ServeContent`), where certain headers like `ETag`, `Last-Modified`, and `Cache-Control` might be stripped by default in recent versions, which could be unexpected or undesirable in some scenarios, while *not* stripping them could also be incorrect if the error means the original content (and its caching headers) is no longer relevant.

## **5. Common Mistakes That Cause This**

- **Omitting Cache Headers:** Failing to set any `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers for sensitive content. Default behavior of caches can vary, potentially leading to caching.
- **Overly Permissive `Cache-Control`:** Using `public` or long `max-age` directives for private, user-specific, or frequently changing sensitive data.
    
    **1**
    
- **Incorrect Use of `no-cache` vs. `no-store`:** Using `no-cache` when `no-store` is required. `no-cache` still allows storage, just requiring revalidation, which might not be sufficient protection against certain cache-based attacks or forensic analysis. `no-store` prevents storage altogether.
    
    **4**
    
- **Inconsistent Header Application:** Applying secure cache headers to the main HTML page but failing to protect API endpoints that return sensitive data fetched by client-side scripts.
- **Ignoring Intermediate Caches:** Setting `Cache-Control: private` but failing to consider that sensitive data might still be cached by the browser, posing a risk on shared devices.
- **Misunderstanding Go's `http.Error` Behavior:** Relying on specific caching headers (`ETag`, `Last-Modified`, `Cache-Control`) being preserved when `http.Error` is called, unaware that recent Go versions might strip them by default to prevent incorrect caching of error responses. Conversely, forcing headers to be kept via workarounds like `GODEBUG=httpcleanerrorheaders=0` might inadvertently cause error pages to be cached inappropriately.
    
- **Not Using Versioned URLs for Assets:** Serving static assets (CSS, JS) with long cache times but without versioning in the URL. This makes it difficult to force clients to download updated versions promptly.

## **6. Exploitation Goals**

Attackers exploiting broken caching headers typically aim to:

- **Access Sensitive Information:** Retrieve cached data belonging to previous users of a shared browser or proxy, such as session tokens, personal details, financial data, or application-specific sensitive information.
    
- **Session Hijacking:** If session identifiers are improperly cached, an attacker might be able to reuse a victim's session.
- **Bypass Access Controls:** View restricted content that was cached when an authorized user was logged in.
- **Cache Poisoning:** In more advanced scenarios, particularly involving intermediate caches like CDNs, an attacker might manipulate requests to cause the cache to store a malicious or incorrect response, serving it to legitimate users. This can lead to phishing, defacement, or denial of service.

## **7. Affected Components or Files**

- **Golang `net/http` Handlers:** Any HTTP handler function that writes sensitive data to the `http.ResponseWriter` without setting appropriate cache-inhibiting headers.
- **Custom Middleware:** Middleware layers that interact with or set HTTP headers can introduce vulnerabilities if not carefully implemented, especially concerning caching. Middleware might also inadvertently interfere with headers set by inner handlers.

- **Web Frameworks:** Higher-level web frameworks built on `net/http` might provide abstractions for header setting, but misconfiguration remains possible.
- **Reverse Proxies and CDNs:** Configuration of caching behavior in reverse proxies (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) or CDNs is crucial. Application-level headers can be overridden or modified at these layers.
- **Client-Side Scripts:** JavaScript fetching sensitive data from APIs must ensure the corresponding API responses have correct cache headers.

## **8. Vulnerable Code Snippet**

```Go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

// Assume getUserSensitiveData retrieves sensitive info for the logged-in user
func getUserSensitiveData(userID string) string {
	// In a real app, fetch from DB based on session/token
	return fmt.Sprintf("Sensitive data for user %s: Account Balance $1234.56", userID)
}

func sensitiveDataHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// Assume user is authenticated and userID is available
	userID := "user123"
	data := getUserSensitiveData(userID)

	// Vulnerability: No cache control headers are set!
	// A browser or intermediate cache might store this response.
	// Setting permissive headers would also be vulnerable:
	// w.Header().Set("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=3600") // Incorrect!

	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html")
	fmt.Fprintln(w, "<h1>User Account</h1>")
	fmt.Fprintln(w, "<p>", data, "</p>")
	fmt.Fprintln(w, "<p>Generated: ", time.Now(), "</p>")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/account", sensitiveDataHandler)
	fmt.Println("Server starting on port 8080...")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

**Explanation:** The `sensitiveDataHandler` writes user-specific sensitive data to the response but fails to set any `Cache-Control` headers. Depending on default browser and proxy behavior, this response might be cached. If accessed on a shared system, a subsequent user could potentially view `user123`'s data via the browser cache or back button, even after `user123` has logged out.**2**

## **9. Detection Steps**

1. **Manual Code Review:** Examine Golang HTTP handlers, middleware, and framework configurations. Look for routes serving sensitive data. Check if `w.Header().Set()` is used to apply appropriate `Cache-Control` directives (e.g., `no-store` or `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`) for these routes. Pay attention to error handling paths and how headers are managed there.
    
2. **Browser Developer Tools:**
    - Log in to the application and navigate to pages displaying sensitive information.
    - Open the browser's developer tools (usually F12) and go to the "Network" tab.
    - Refresh the page and inspect the HTTP response headers for the relevant request. Verify the `Cache-Control`, `Pragma`, and `Expires` headers.
    - Log out of the application.
    - Attempt to navigate back to the sensitive page using the browser's back button or history. Check if the sensitive data is displayed from the cache.
    
    - Check the "Cache Storage" or equivalent section in developer tools (Application tab) to see if sensitive responses are stored.
3. **Proxy Analysis:** Use an intercepting proxy (like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP) to monitor HTTP traffic. Inspect response headers for all requests, especially those containing sensitive data. Check the proxy's cache to see if sensitive responses are stored.
4. **Automated Scanning:** Employ Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools or specialized vulnerability scanners. These tools often include checks for missing or insecure caching headers.

## **10. Proof of Concept (PoC)**

This PoC demonstrates browser caching of sensitive data:

1. **Setup:** Deploy the vulnerable Go code snippet provided above.
2. **Action 1 (User A):** Open a web browser (ensure caching is enabled, which is the default). Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/account`. Observe the sensitive data ("Account Balance $1234.56").
3. **Action 2 (User A):** Simulate logout (in a real app, this would invalidate the session). Close the browser tab *without clearing the cache*.
4. **Action 3 (User B / Attacker):** On the same browser/computer, reopen the browser. Try to access the history or use the back button to return to `http://localhost:8080/account`.
5. **Result:** If the vulnerability exists and the browser cached the response, User B will see the sensitive data belonging to User A, even though User A is logged out. The timestamp shown might also indicate it's a cached version. Inspecting network tools during Action 3 might show a "(from disk cache)" or similar status instead of a live network request.

## **11. Risk Classification**

- **Likelihood:** Medium. Common mistakes like omitting headers or using incorrect directives are frequent. However, exploitation often requires specific conditions (shared browser, accessible proxy cache).
- **Impact:** Medium to High. Depends entirely on the sensitivity of the cached data. Disclosure of configuration details might be Low impact, while exposure of session tokens, PII, or financial data is High impact.

- **Overall:** Medium-High, warranting careful attention during development and testing.

## **12. Fix & Patch Guidance**

To fix and prevent broken caching header vulnerabilities in Golang applications:

1. **Set Secure Defaults:** For any response containing sensitive or user-specific data, explicitly set restrictive cache headers. The strongest recommendation is often:

Alternatively, `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` provides strong protection.
    
    ```Go
    
    w.Header().Set("Cache-Control", "no-store")
    w.Header().Set("Pragma", "no-cache") // For HTTP/1.0 compatibility
    w.Header().Set("Expires", "0") // For proxies
    ```
    
2. **Apply Headers Correctly:** Ensure these headers are set *before* any part of the response body is written.
3. **Use Middleware:** Implement middleware to apply default security headers, including cache control, consistently across sensitive endpoints. Be cautious that middleware doesn't conflict with specific handler requirements.
4. **Handle Errors Carefully:** When using `http.Error` or similar error paths, be aware of Go's default behavior regarding header stripping. If specific caching headers *must* be preserved even on errors (rarely advisable for sensitive data caching headers), understand the implications and potential workarounds like `GODEBUG=httpcleanerrorheaders=0` or manually setting headers after the error condition is known but before `http.Error` is called (if possible). Generally, error responses should also prevent caching of potentially sensitive error messages.

5. **Static Assets:** For non-sensitive, unchanging static assets (like versioned CSS/JS), use long cache durations:

Use versioning in filenames (e.g., `style.x234dff.css`) to ensure updates are fetched.
    
    ```Go
    
    // Assuming style.v123.css contains versioning
    w.Header().Set("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=31536000, immutable") // 1 year + immutable
    ```
    
6. **Conditional Requests:** For resources that change but can be cached briefly, implement `ETag` or `Last-Modified` headers and handle `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since` request headers to return `304 Not Modified` when appropriate, saving bandwidth.
    
    ```Go
    
    eTag := calculateEtag(resourceContent)
    w.Header().Set("Etag", eTag)
    w.Header().Set("Cache-Control", "max-age=60, must-revalidate") // Example: Cache for 60s, then revalidate
    
    if match := r.Header.Get("If-None-Match"); match!= "" {
        if strings.Contains(match, eTag) {
            w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotModified)
            return
        }
    }
    //... serve full content...
    ```
    

## **13. Scope and Impact**

Improper cache control can lead to:

- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive user data (PII, financial info, session tokens) stored in browser or proxy caches.
- **Integrity Issues:** Users may be served stale data if `must-revalidate` or similar directives are not used appropriately for dynamic content, leading to incorrect information display or application state.
    
- **Availability Issues:** In CDN cache poisoning scenarios, legitimate content can be replaced with malicious content or error pages, making the site unavailable or untrustworthy for many users.

- **Session Hijacking:** If session identifiers are cached and retrieved by an attacker.
- **Compliance Violations:** Depending on the data exposed and applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), improper caching can lead to significant compliance failures and fines.

The scope can range from a single user on a shared machine to potentially all users behind a compromised or misconfigured intermediate cache (like a corporate proxy or CDN).

## **14. Remediation Recommendation**

1. **Prioritize `Cache-Control: no-store`:** For all responses containing sensitive, private, or user-specific data, use `Cache-Control: no-store` as the primary defense. Supplement with `Pragma: no-cache` and `Expires: 0` for broader compatibility.

2. **Audit Sensitive Endpoints:** Systematically review all application endpoints (HTML pages, API routes) that handle or display sensitive information. Verify that appropriate cache-inhibiting headers are consistently applied.
3. **Configure Intermediate Caches:** Ensure that configurations for CDNs and reverse proxies align with the application's caching strategy and do not override security-critical headers inappropriately.
4. **Use Versioning for Cacheable Assets:** Implement fingerprinting or version numbers in the URLs of static assets (CSS, JS, images) and apply long `max-age` cache headers (`public, max-age=31536000, immutable`) to these versioned resources.

5. **Educate Developers:** Ensure developers understand the purpose and correct usage of HTTP caching headers and the risks associated with misconfiguration, particularly the distinction between `no-cache` and `no-store`. Highlight potential pitfalls with Go's standard library behavior around error handling.
    
6. **Regular Testing:** Incorporate checks for improper caching into regular security testing routines, including manual review, browser-based testing, and automated scanning.

## **15. Summary**

Broken Caching Headers represent a significant web security vulnerability where improper configuration of HTTP cache-related headers (`Cache-Control`, `Pragma`, `Expires`) allows sensitive information to be stored by browsers or intermediate proxies. In Golang applications, this typically results from developers omitting necessary headers or applying overly permissive directives (like `public` or long `max-age`) to responses containing private data using the `net/http` package. Exploitation can lead to sensitive data disclosure, session hijacking, and potentially cache poisoning, with severity ranging from Medium to High depending on the data exposed.Detection involves code review, browser developer tools, and proxy analysis. Remediation requires diligently applying restrictive headers like `Cache-Control: no-store` to all sensitive responses, using versioning and long cache times for static assets, and understanding potential nuances in Go's error handling concerning headers. Consistent application of secure caching policies is crucial for protecting user data and application integrity.
