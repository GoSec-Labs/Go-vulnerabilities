# Leaky Metrics Endpoints (metrics-endpoints-leak)

## Vulnerability Title

Leaky Metrics Endpoints (metrics-endpoints-leak)

## Severity Rating

HighðŸŸ 

The classification of this vulnerability as High severity is based on the combined potential for significant information leakage and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Publicly exposed diagnostic and monitoring interfaces can divulge sensitive credentials, API keys, and internal network details, providing invaluable reconnaissance data to malicious actors. Concurrently, these same endpoints can be weaponized to disrupt system availability. The widespread prevalence of such exposures amplifies the overall attack surface and provides readily available avenues for sophisticated, multi-stage cyberattacks.

The analysis indicates that the core issue extends beyond merely "metrics" endpoints. Research consistently points to the `/metrics` endpoint (commonly used for Prometheus-style monitoring) and the `/debug/pprof` endpoints (Go's built-in profiling tools) as primary vectors for this vulnerability. While `/metrics` primarily facilitates information disclosure, `/debug/pprof` introduces a direct DoS risk. The frequent co-occurrence of these exposures, often due to similar underlying misconfigurations, necessitates addressing them under a unified vulnerability class of "Exposed Diagnostic/Monitoring Endpoints." This broader perspective is crucial for developing comprehensive remediation strategies that encompass all such inadvertently exposed internal interfaces.

## Description

Leaky metrics endpoints, or `metrics-endpoints-leak`, represent a critical security vulnerability arising from the improper exposure of monitoring and debugging interfaces within Golang applications. These interfaces, notably the `/metrics` endpoint (designed for Prometheus-style application and system metrics) and the `/debug/pprof` endpoints (utilized for Go's built-in runtime profiling), are intended for internal operational visibility and performance diagnostics.

The vulnerability manifests when these endpoints are inadvertently made publicly accessible without adequate authentication, authorization, or network restrictions. This misconfiguration transforms essential internal tools into significant attack vectors. Cybersecurity research has identified hundreds of thousands of Prometheus instances and Node Exporters publicly exposed on the internet, highlighting the pervasive nature of this issue. Such widespread exposure enables attackers to gather sensitive system information, map internal infrastructure, and initiate denial-of-service attacks, posing a substantial risk to organizational security.

## Technical Description (for security pros)

### Overview of Prometheus `/metrics` Endpoints in Go

Go applications frequently integrate the `github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus` library to instrument and expose various application and system metrics. These metrics are typically served over HTTP, conventionally at a `/metrics` path. The `promhttp.Handler()` function or `promhttp.HandlerFor()` (when a custom registry is employed) from the `prometheus/promhttp` package is the standard mechanism for serving these metrics. Metrics are presented in a specific text-based format, which includes `# HELP` (for description), `# TYPE` (for metric type), and the metric's current value, a format readily parsable by Prometheus servers. By default, the Prometheus Go client library often exposes a range of standard Go runtime metrics, such as memory usage, heap statistics, and goroutine counts, in addition to any custom application-specific metrics defined by the developer.

### Overview of Go's Built-in Profiling (`/debug/pprof`) Endpoints

The `net/http/pprof` package within Go's standard library provides HTTP endpoints that expose runtime profiling data. These endpoints offer deep insights into an application's behavior, including CPU usage (`/debug/pprof/cpu`), memory heap allocations (`/debug/pprof/heap`), goroutine stack traces, and thread creation statistics (`/debug/pprof/threadcreate`). These profiling capabilities are invaluable for diagnosing performance bottlenecks, identifying memory leaks, and understanding the runtime characteristics of Go services. A simple import of `_ "net/http/pprof"` automatically registers these handlers under the `/debug/pprof/` path within the default HTTP server.

### Mechanisms of Information Exposure

When left unsecured, the `/metrics` endpoint can inadvertently expose a wealth of sensitive operational and internal system information. This includes, but is not limited to, internal API endpoints, subdomains, Docker registry URLs, Docker image metadata, and, critically, credentials, passwords, authentication tokens, and API keys if these are mistakenly included in metric labels or values. This data is highly valuable for attackers conducting reconnaissance and mapping internal systems.

Similarly, unrestricted access to `/debug/pprof` endpoints can reveal intricate details about the application's internal architecture, function call patterns, memory allocation behavior, and potentially sensitive strings present in memory dumps. This granular information can be leveraged by attackers for targeted exploitation, understanding application logic, and identifying potential weak points.

### Potential for Resource Exhaustion via Profiling Endpoints

The `/debug/pprof` endpoints, particularly `/debug/pprof/heap` and `/debug/pprof/cpu`, are designed to trigger resource-intensive profiling tasks to collect comprehensive diagnostic data. An attacker can exploit this by sending a high volume of concurrent requests to these endpoints. This action forces the target server to perform computationally expensive operations, leading to excessive CPU utilization, increased memory consumption, and ultimately, a Denial of Service (DoS) by rendering the application unresponsive or causing it to crash. This aligns with CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).

The very utility of these diagnostic endpoints â€” detailed profiling and deep introspection â€” becomes their security Achilles' heel when exposed. The design choice to make them easily accessible for developers, often by simply importing a package, creates a high-risk default if not explicitly secured. This highlights a fundamental tension between developer convenience for diagnostics and the necessity for robust security in production environments. The intended function of `pprof` is to consume resources to generate detailed performance reports. When this functionality is exposed without access controls, an attacker can intentionally trigger this resource consumption, turning a diagnostic feature into a weapon for DoS. This is not a flaw in `pprof`'s functionality, but a critical security misconfiguration in its deployment. It underscores that any feature designed for internal, privileged access must be secured by default in production. The ease of enabling `pprof` without a strong, built-in security mechanism for production use creates a significant attack surface that developers might overlook.

## Common Mistakes That Cause This

### Lack of Authentication and Authorization on Endpoints

The most common and critical mistake is deploying Go applications with `/metrics` or `/debug/pprof` endpoints accessible without any form of authentication or authorization. Go's Prometheus client library and `net/http/pprof` do not enforce authentication by default; developers are required to explicitly implement these security measures. This often leads to oversight, particularly in rapid development cycles or when applications transition from development to production environments.

This is not merely a "developer forgot" issue; it represents a fundamental failure in the "secure-by-default" principle for diagnostic and monitoring components. If a library or framework provides powerful internal diagnostic endpoints, they should ideally be secured by default or require explicit, conscious opt-in for any public exposure. The current default behavior (unsecured) for these potentially high-impact endpoints constitutes a significant security risk for production deployments. If a critical security control like authentication is not the default behavior for a feature with severe security implications when exposed, it places the burden of security entirely on the developer. This increases the likelihood of misconfiguration due to oversight or a lack of specialized security expertise within development teams. This points to a broader industry challenge where developer convenience, such as easy diagnostics, sometimes outweighs the implementation of secure defaults. For critical infrastructure components, "secure by default" should be paramount, requiring explicit configuration to *relax* security, rather than to *add* it. This shifts the responsibility for security from remembering to implement it to actively deciding to weaken it.

### Public Exposure of Internal Endpoints

Another prevalent mistake is allowing direct internet access to these diagnostic and monitoring endpoints instead of strictly restricting them to private networks, VPNs, or specific trusted IP addresses. This often results from misconfigured network firewalls, cloud security groups, or reverse proxies. The alarming statistics of hundreds of thousands of publicly exposed Prometheus instances and Node Exporters underscore the prevalence of this misconfiguration.

### Insufficient Filtering or Redaction of Sensitive Data in Metrics

Even when authentication is in place, developers may inadvertently include sensitive data such as credentials, API keys, personal identifiable information (PII), or internal system details within metric labels or values. This often occurs because developers may not be fully aware of the full scope of data collected by default metrics or the potential for custom metrics to expose sensitive information.

The primary goal of observability, which involves collecting comprehensive data, often directly conflicts with the security principle of least privilege, which dictates exposing only necessary information. Developers, in their pursuit of rich monitoring data, might inadvertently include sensitive operational details. This highlights a need for better tools or development practices that can automatically identify and warn about sensitive data patterns within metric definitions. If sensitive information is part of the application's internal state or configuration, such as connection strings or API keys for third-party services, it can easily be included in metrics, especially if developers are not explicitly filtering or redacting. This suggests that security teams need to actively educate developers on what constitutes sensitive data in the context of observability. Furthermore, it points to the potential value of automated static analysis or dynamic analysis tools that can scan metric definitions and generated metric output for common sensitive data patterns, providing proactive warnings before deployment.

### Mismanagement of Go's Runtime Profiling (pprof)

Leaving `/debug/pprof` endpoints enabled in production environments without stringent access controls allows attackers to trigger resource-intensive profiling operations on demand. A lack of understanding regarding the significant resource implications of running profiling on a live, production system, especially under a malicious attack, contributes to this risk.

### Unbounded Resource Creation Leading to Memory Leaks

While not a direct cause of "leaky metrics endpoints," memory leaks are a common class of issues in Go applications that `pprof` is designed to help diagnose. Common causes of memory leaks in Go include unbounded caches, long-lived references (e.g., global variables, goroutines that never terminate, maps or slices that grow indefinitely without shrinking), and improper use of `defer` in loops. An attacker exploiting an unsecured `/debug/pprof` endpoint for DoS can exacerbate existing memory leak issues, leading to faster resource exhaustion and Out-Of-Memory (OOM) kills.

The diagnostic tools designed to identify performance issues and memory leaks (pprof, Datadog profiler, Pyroscope) can paradoxically become part of the attack surface if they are themselves unsecured. This creates a security paradox where the solution to one problem (performance/memory leaks) inadvertently creates another (security vulnerability) if not handled with extreme care. This highlights the need for secure-by-design principles for all operational tools. If an attacker gains access to `pprof` data, they are effectively gaining access to the application's internal diagnostic reports. This allows them to pinpoint the exact functions or data structures responsible for memory leaks. This enables an attacker to move beyond generic DoS attacks to highly surgical ones. Instead of simply flooding the endpoint, they can craft inputs or sequences of operations that specifically trigger or accelerate the identified memory leaks, making the DoS more potent and harder to defend against without fixing the underlying code. Furthermore, if the memory leak involves sensitive data, such as a cache retaining user sessions, the profiling data itself could inadvertently expose fragments of this data, or the attacker could use the leak to induce a crash that results in a memory dump containing sensitive information.

## Exploitation Goals

### Reconnaissance and Network Mapping

Attackers can leverage publicly exposed `/metrics` endpoints to gather critical intelligence about the target environment. This includes mapping internal systems, discovering internal API endpoints, identifying subdomains, and obtaining Docker registry URLs and container image metadata. This reconnaissance data is invaluable for planning and executing subsequent, more targeted attacks. Access to `/debug/pprof` can further reveal the application's internal structure, dependencies, and runtime behavior, aiding in the development of custom exploits.

### Sensitive Data Exfiltration (Credentials, API Keys, Internal Details)

Directly querying unauthenticated `/metrics` endpoints can lead to the unauthorized acquisition of sensitive information, such as credentials, passwords, API keys, and authentication tokens, if these are inadvertently exposed within metric labels or values. This direct leakage of secrets can provide an immediate and critical initial foothold into an organization's broader systems and infrastructure.

### Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

Attackers can launch effective DoS attacks by sending multiple concurrent requests to resource-intensive `/debug/pprof` endpoints (e.g., `/debug/pprof/heap`, `/debug/pprof/cpu`). These requests force the server to perform complex, CPU and memory-intensive profiling tasks, leading to rapid resource exhaustion, application unresponsiveness, and ultimately, crashes or Out-Of-Memory (OOM) kills.

### Facilitation of Lateral Movement and Further Compromise

The intelligence gained from leaked internal API endpoints, subdomains, and network topology information via `/metrics` significantly aids attackers in planning targeted attacks and navigating laterally within the compromised network. Compromised credentials or API keys obtained through information leakage can be directly used to access other internal systems, services, or cloud resources, escalating the breach.

The exploitation of leaky metrics endpoints extends far beyond simple data theft or service disruption. It acts as a force multiplier for attackers, providing them with a free, unauthenticated internal network map and potential credential dump. This significantly lowers the barrier for more sophisticated, multi-stage attack campaigns, making the initial compromise easier and faster. Reconnaissance is the foundational phase of most advanced cyberattacks. By providing this information without any authentication, the vulnerability short-circuits the attacker's reconnaissance efforts, allowing them to bypass initial defensive layers and quickly identify high-value targets or pathways for deeper penetration. This means the risk is not contained to the immediate application but extends to the entire organizational network and connected systems. The "leaky metrics" are not merely an isolated vulnerability but a critical enabler for broader attack campaigns, potentially leading to widespread compromise.

## Affected Components or Files

The primary affected components are Go applications configured to expose diagnostic and monitoring interfaces. This includes:

- **Go applications exposing `/metrics` via `prometheus/client_golang`:** Any Go application that integrates the `github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus` library and registers an HTTP handler for the `/metrics` endpoint, typically using `promhttp.Handler()` or `promhttp.HandlerFor()`. This encompasses applications built with popular Go web frameworks, such as Gin, that incorporate Prometheus handlers.
- **Go applications exposing `/debug/pprof` via `net/http/pprof`:** Applications that import `net/http/pprof` (e.g., `_ "net/http/pprof"`). This import automatically registers the profiling handlers. This practice is common in development and staging environments for debugging, but it can mistakenly be left enabled and exposed in production.
- **Associated configuration files:** While not directly vulnerable, misconfigurations in files such as Prometheus scrape configurations (`prometheus.yml`) can exacerbate the problem. Similarly, Dockerfiles or deployment scripts that expose application ports to public networks without proper network segmentation can contribute to the vulnerability.

It is crucial to emphasize that the "Leaky metrics endpoints" vulnerability is *not* a flaw or bug in the Go language itself, its numeric precision (e.g., float-to-int conversion issues documented in ), or other Go-specific vulnerabilities like slice mutability  or `GOMAXPROCS` behavior. Instead, this is fundamentally a *misconfiguration* vulnerability related to the insecure deployment and usage of standard Go packages designed for diagnostics and monitoring. The functionality itself is not flawed, but its exposure without proper security controls creates the vulnerability.

The distinction between a "Go language vulnerability" (e.g., a bug in the compiler or runtime) and a "Go application misconfiguration vulnerability" (e.g., improper use of standard libraries) is critical for accurate threat modeling and effective remediation. The extensive research on float-to-int conversion issues and other Go-specific bugs, while important for other contexts, is not directly relevant to the "leaky metrics endpoints" problem. This reinforces that the solution for this specific vulnerability lies in secure development and deployment practices, rather than awaiting a Go language patch. This means that tools like `govulncheck` , which identify known vulnerabilities in Go modules, might not directly flag this issue as a "vulnerability" in a dependency, but rather it is a misconfiguration that needs to be addressed through secure coding practices, deployment hardening, and security audits. It emphasizes that secure development extends beyond merely patching known CVEs in dependencies.

## Vulnerable Code Snippet

### Example of an insecurely exposed Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus"
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp"
)

var (
    // Insecure: API key exposed as a label for demonstration purposes
    SensitiveMetric = prometheus.NewGaugeVec(prometheus.GaugeOpts{
        Name: "app_sensitive_info",
        Help: "Sensitive application information.",
    },string{"key_type", "value"})
)

func init() {
    prometheus.MustRegister(SensitiveMetric) // Register with the default Prometheus registry
}

func main() {
    SensitiveMetric.WithLabelValues("api_key", "sk_live_verysecretkey123").Set(1)
    SensitiveMetric.WithLabelValues("internal_api_path", "/admin/users/delete").Set(1)

    // Expose the metrics endpoint on /metrics without any authentication
    http.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())

    // Start the HTTP server, listening on all network interfaces on port 8080
    // This makes the /metrics endpoint publicly accessible if the host is internet-facing
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

This code snippet, adapted from examples in , illustrates the minimal setup required to expose a Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint in a Go application. The critical vulnerability lies in the `http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)` call. By default, this listens on all available network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`), making the `/metrics` endpoint publicly accessible if the host is internet-facing. Crucially, no authentication or authorization is implemented, allowing any external party to scrape sensitive metrics.

### Example of an insecurely exposed `/debug/pprof` endpoint

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    _ "net/http/pprof" // Automatically registers handlers for /debug/pprof
    "time"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // The simple import statement above is sufficient to register pprof handlers
    // No explicit call to http.Handle is needed for pprof endpoints.

    // Start the HTTP server, listening on all network interfaces on port 8080
    // This exposes the /debug/pprof endpoints publicly if the host is internet-facing
    go func() {
        log.Println(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
    }()

    // Keep the main goroutine alive
    select {}
}
```

This snippet demonstrates how easily Go's built-in profiling endpoints can be exposed. Simply importing `_ "net/http/pprof"` automatically registers a suite of powerful diagnostic handlers under `/debug/pprof`. If the application's HTTP server is configured to listen on a publicly accessible interface and port (as shown by `http.ListenAndServe`), these endpoints become exposed without any built-in authentication. This enables attackers to trigger resource-intensive profiling tasks, leading to DoS, and gather sensitive internal application details.

## Detection Steps

### Network Scanning and Endpoint Discovery

Proactive scanning of an organization's public-facing IP ranges and known application ports for the presence of `/metrics` and `/debug/pprof` endpoints is a fundamental detection step. Standard network scanning tools like `nmap`, `curl`, or more specialized vulnerability scanners can effectively identify these open interfaces. Furthermore, utilizing internet-wide search engines such as Shodan can reveal publicly exposed Prometheus instances and Node Exporters, as historical data indicates hundreds of thousands of such exposures. This method can uncover external exposures that may be unknown to the organization.

The sheer volume of publicly exposed instances (296,000 Prometheus Node Exporter, 40,300 Prometheus servers, as per ) implies that attackers are already actively scanning for and exploiting these vulnerabilities. This makes basic, low-effort network scanning a highly effective detection method for adversaries. Consequently, organizations must implement continuous external attack surface management (EASM) and regular penetration testing that specifically includes reconnaissance for such diagnostic endpoints. This underscores the urgent need for organizations to adopt an "attacker's mindset" in their security assessments. Regular, automated external reconnaissance of their own assets is no longer a luxury but a necessity. This proactive scanning should be integrated into continuous security monitoring to identify and remediate exposures before malicious actors exploit them.

### Traffic Analysis for Anomalous Access Patterns

Implementing robust network monitoring is essential to detect unusual traffic patterns targeting `/metrics` or `/debug/pprof` endpoints. Security teams should look for access attempts originating from external or untrusted IP addresses, or sudden, uncharacteristic spikes in request volume. Leveraging network monitoring tools such as Wireshark or Zeek for deep packet inspection and traffic flow analysis can help identify suspicious communications.

### Log Monitoring for Suspicious Queries

Establishing comprehensive logging for web servers and application access is critical, with active review of these logs for suspicious queries. Specifically, security personnel should look for attempts to access sensitive metrics (e.g., those containing API keys, credentials, subdomains) or excessive, sequential requests indicative of an attacker attempting to map available metrics. Monitoring for repeated access attempts to `/debug/pprof` endpoints, particularly `/heap` or `/cpu`, are strong indicators of a potential denial-of-service attack.

### Utilizing Go's `govulncheck` and Profiling Tools

While `govulncheck`  is primarily designed to report known vulnerabilities in Go modules and their transitive dependencies, it may not directly flag misconfigurations like exposed endpoints. Nevertheless, it remains a crucial tool for maintaining overall Go application security by identifying vulnerable library versions. Leveraging Go's built-in profiling tools (`pprof`) and integrating with continuous profiling solutions (e.g., Datadog Continuous Profiler, Grafana Pyroscope) can monitor application memory and goroutine usage. Although these are diagnostic tools, they can help identify symptoms of resource exhaustion (e.g., high CPU, increasing memory usage) if an attack is underway or if underlying memory leaks are present, providing indirect detection capabilities.

The very diagnostic tools designed to *find* performance issues and memory leaks (pprof, Datadog profiler, Pyroscope) can paradoxically become part of the attack surface if they are themselves unsecured. This creates a security paradox where the solution to one problem (performance/memory leaks) inadvertently creates another (security vulnerability) if not handled with extreme care. This highlights the need for secure-by-design principles for all operational tools. The data exposed by these profiling tools (e.g., stack traces, memory allocation patterns, goroutine states) is highly detailed and often sensitive. If the endpoints serving this data are exposed, an attacker gains access to internal operational intelligence that can be used to craft more effective exploits or identify deeper vulnerabilities. This emphasizes a critical security principle: "security by design." Diagnostic and monitoring features, despite their internal purpose, must be designed and deployed with security in mind from the outset. This means integrating authentication, authorization, and network isolation as fundamental requirements for their deployment, rather than treating them as optional add-ons. Failing to do so transforms valuable debugging tools into potent reconnaissance and DoS vectors.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

### Demonstrating Information Leakage from `/metrics`

1. **Setup:** Deploy a simple Go application that exposes a `/metrics` endpoint without any authentication, similar to the "Vulnerable Code Snippet" provided earlier. For demonstration purposes, ensure that a sensitive piece of information, such as a mock API key or an internal administrative path, is inadvertently included as a label or value within one of the exposed Prometheus metrics.
2. **Exploitation Steps:** An attacker, without any prior knowledge or credentials, can simply use a common command-line tool like `curl` or a web browser to access the exposed `/metrics` endpoint.
Bash
    
    `curl http://[target_ip]:[port]/metrics`
    
3. **Expected Observation:** The response body will contain all exposed metrics in the Prometheus text format. The sensitive information (e.g., `sk_live_verysecretkey123` and `/admin/users/delete`) will be clearly visible within the metric output, demonstrating direct information leakage.

### Demonstrating DoS via `/debug/pprof`

1. **Setup:** Deploy a Go application that includes `_ "net/http/pprof"` and is accessible without authentication, similar to the "Vulnerable Code Snippet" provided earlier. Ensure the application is running on a resource-constrained environment or is designed to be susceptible to high CPU/memory loads when profiling is triggered.
2. **Exploitation Steps:** An attacker can send a high volume of concurrent requests to the resource-intensive `/debug/pprof/cpu` or `/debug/pprof/heap` endpoints. The `seconds` parameter for CPU profiling dictates the duration of the profiling sample.
    - *Example using `curl` in a loop (for demonstration; a real attack would use a more sophisticated load testing tool like `vegeta` or `hey`):*Bash
        
        `# Trigger multiple concurrent CPU profiles, each for 10 seconds
        for i in $(seq 1 50); do curl -s -o /dev/null "http://[target_ip]:[port]/debug/pprof/cpu?seconds=10" & done
        # Or trigger memory heap dumps repeatedly
        # for i in $(seq 1 50); do curl -s -o /dev/null "http://[target_ip]:[port]/debug/pprof/heap" & done`
        
3. **Expected Observation:** Monitor the target application's system resources (CPU, memory) using tools like `top`, `htop`, or cloud provider monitoring dashboards. The application's CPU utilization will spike significantly, memory consumption may rapidly increase (especially with heap profiling), leading to degraded performance, unresponsiveness, or even a complete crash/OOM kill. This demonstrates a successful denial-of-service.

The `pprof` endpoints are particularly dangerous because they allow an attacker to trigger *expensive* operations on demand. Unlike a simple HTTP flood that might primarily consume network bandwidth, these requests force the application to perform complex, CPU-intensive tasks (profiling, memory analysis, data serialization), making DoS easier to achieve with fewer, targeted requests. The very purpose of profiling is to collect detailed data, which is a resource-intensive operation. When an attacker can repeatedly and concurrently trigger these operations without authorization, they are effectively forcing the application to exhaust its own resources. This implies that even applications robust against typical HTTP flooding, such as those protected by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) or basic rate limiting, might still be vulnerable to this type of targeted resource exhaustion attack. It highlights the critical need for granular access control and stringent rate limiting on *all* diagnostic and management endpoints, not just general application endpoints.

## Risk Classification

### CWE-ID

- **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor:** This CWE is directly applicable to the leakage of credentials, API keys, and internal network details via `/metrics` and sensitive profiling data from `/debug/pprof`. It describes the fundamental flaw of making sensitive data accessible to unauthorized individuals.
- **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** This CWE precisely describes the DoS potential of `/debug/pprof` endpoints, where attackers can trigger resource-intensive operations. The application consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory) in response to unauthenticated requests, leading to service degradation or outage.
- **CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security:** While not the primary CWE, if any access controls are only implemented client-side (e.g., in a browser-based monitoring dashboard) and not strictly enforced on the server-side endpoint itself, this could be a contributing factor to the vulnerability.

### CVSS v3.1 Score (Example Calculation)

For a publicly exposed, unauthenticated endpoint leaking credentials and allowing DoS:

- **Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)** - The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network, requiring no physical access or local privileges.
- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)** - Exploitation requires no special conditions, advanced knowledge, or complex techniques; simple HTTP requests are sufficient.
- **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)** - No authentication or authorization is needed to access and exploit the exposed endpoints.
- **User Interaction (UI): None (N)** - No user interaction is required for the attacker to perform the exploitation.
- **Scope (S): Unchanged (U)** - The vulnerability affects the component directly and does not impact components outside its security scope.
- **Confidentiality Impact (C): High (H)** - Sensitive information, including credentials, API keys, internal network maps, and application internals, is exposed, leading to a potential complete loss of confidentiality for that data.
- **Integrity Impact (I): Low (L)** - While leaked credentials could indirectly lead to integrity compromise in other systems, the direct impact of this vulnerability on the integrity of the affected application's data is not the primary concern. The core issue is information disclosure and availability.
- **Availability Impact (A): High (H)** - Denial-of-Service attacks via `/debug/pprof` endpoints can render the system completely inoperable, leading to a total loss of availability.

**Base Score:** 9.1 (Critical)

### Overall Risk Score

Critical (High)

### Risk Classification Justification

The widespread public exposure of these endpoints , combined with the extremely low barrier to exploitation (requiring no authentication and simple HTTP requests), and the high impact on both confidentiality (direct leakage of critical secrets and internal data) and availability (complete service disruption through DoS), positions this as a critical risk. The information gained from such an exposure can directly facilitate further, more severe attacks, including broader system compromise and even remote code execution in certain contexts, such as via RepoJacking (as mentioned in ), which can be aided by leaked Docker image information.

## Fix & Patch Guidance

### Implement Robust Authentication and Authorization

The most critical remediation step is to implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all `/metrics` and `/debug/pprof` endpoints.

- **Basic Authentication or mTLS:** For Prometheus `/metrics` endpoints, implement HTTP Basic Authentication or Mutual TLS (mTLS) to ensure only authorized Prometheus servers or monitoring agents can access the data. Hardcoded credentials should be avoided; instead, utilize secure options like environment variables or a configuration management system.
- **Dedicated Authentication Middleware:** For applications built with web frameworks like Gin, integrate authentication middleware *before* registering the Prometheus or pprof handlers, ensuring that all requests to these endpoints are authenticated.
- **Restrict `pprof` in Production:** For `/debug/pprof` endpoints, consider disabling them entirely in production environments if not strictly necessary. If they must be enabled for on-demand diagnostics, ensure they are protected by robust authentication that is separate from standard application authentication, ideally requiring elevated privileges.

### Enforce Strict Network Segmentation

Never expose diagnostic and monitoring endpoints directly to the public internet.

- **Private Networks/VPNs:** Restrict access to these endpoints to internal, private networks or require access via a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
- **Firewall Rules and Security Groups:** Configure network firewalls, cloud security groups, or Kubernetes network policies to explicitly deny external access to the ports and paths serving these endpoints. Only allow traffic from known, trusted IP addresses (e.g., your Prometheus server's IP).
- **Separate Ports:** Utilize a separate, non-standard port specifically for metrics and profiling endpoints, distinct from the application's main service port, to facilitate easier network segregation.

### Filter and Redact Sensitive Data from Metrics

Review all custom and default metrics to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently exposed.

- **Prometheus `metric_relabel_configs`:** Utilize Prometheus' `metric_relabel_configs` to redact or filter sensitive data before it is exposed via the `/metrics` endpoint.
- **Careful Labeling:** Avoid including PII, credentials, API keys, or internal system configurations in metric labels or values. If sensitive data is necessary for internal debugging, ensure it is heavily obfuscated or aggregated in a non-identifiable way.
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews specifically to identify and remove sensitive data from metric outputs.

### Secure `pprof` Usage and Resource Management

- **Conditional Enabling:** Implement logic to enable `/debug/pprof` endpoints only when explicitly needed, perhaps through a secure configuration flag that requires a restart or is only accessible via a secure, internal management interface.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on all diagnostic endpoints to prevent DoS attacks, even if authentication is in place. This mitigates the risk of resource exhaustion from legitimate but excessive profiling requests or from an attacker who has bypassed authentication.
- **Monitor Resource Usage:** Continuously monitor the application's CPU and memory usage. Alert on spikes or sustained high resource consumption that could indicate a DoS attack targeting profiling endpoints.

### General Secure Coding Practices

- **Memory Leak Prevention:** While `pprof` helps detect memory leaks, preventing them in the first place is crucial. Implement best practices for memory management in Go, such as being mindful of type ranges, explicitly checking for overflow/underflow, handling precision loss in floating-point conversions, and careful management of slices, maps, and goroutines to avoid unbounded growth or long-lived references.
- **Use `govulncheck`:** Regularly use `govulncheck` to identify and update any vulnerable Go modules or dependencies. While it may not directly address misconfigurations, it contributes to overall application security.

## Scope and Impact

The scope of this vulnerability encompasses any Go application that exposes Prometheus `/metrics` or Go's built-in `/debug/pprof` endpoints without adequate security controls. This includes a vast array of microservices, backend APIs, and monitoring agents deployed across various environments, from on-premise servers to cloud infrastructure. The impact is significant and multi-faceted:

- **Confidentiality:** High impact due to the direct exposure of sensitive information, including credentials, API keys, internal network topology, and application internals. This information can be leveraged for reconnaissance, unauthorized access, and broader system compromise.
- **Availability:** High impact due to the potential for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Unauthenticated access to resource-intensive `/debug/pprof` endpoints can lead to severe CPU and memory exhaustion, rendering the application unresponsive or causing crashes.
- **Integrity:** Low direct impact. While the vulnerability primarily affects confidentiality and availability, the compromise of credentials or internal API endpoints could indirectly lead to integrity violations in other systems or data.
- **Attack Surface Expansion:** The exposure of these endpoints significantly expands an organization's attack surface, providing attackers with readily available targets for initial compromise and facilitating lateral movement within the network.
- **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** The leakage of sensitive data, especially PII or proprietary information, can lead to severe regulatory non-compliance issues (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), resulting in substantial fines and reputational damage.

## Remediation Recommendation

The primary remediation recommendation is to adopt a *defense-in-depth* strategy for all diagnostic and monitoring endpoints. This involves combining multiple security controls to create layers of protection, assuming that any single control might fail.

1. **Immediate Action: Network Isolation:** As an immediate measure, ensure that `/metrics` and `/debug/pprof` endpoints are strictly isolated to internal networks. Implement firewall rules, security groups, or network ACLs that explicitly deny all external access to these endpoints and only permit traffic from authorized internal monitoring systems.
2. **Mandatory Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication for all access to these endpoints. This should be a non-negotiable requirement for any production deployment. For Prometheus, implement mTLS or robust HTTP Basic Authentication with securely managed credentials. For `pprof`, consider a separate, highly privileged authentication mechanism.
3. **Sensitive Data Redaction:** Conduct a thorough review of all metrics being exposed. Implement strict filtering and redaction to ensure that no sensitive information (credentials, PII, internal API paths, Docker registry details) is included in metric labels or values. Utilize Prometheus' `metric_relabel_configs` where applicable.
4. **Conditional `pprof` Activation:** In production environments, `_ "net/http/pprof"` should ideally be removed. If `pprof` is absolutely necessary for debugging production issues, it should be enabled only on demand, for a limited time, and with stringent access controls and rate limiting.
5. **Continuous Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement continuous monitoring of network traffic and access logs for these endpoints. Configure alerts for unusual access patterns, high request volumes, or attempts to query sensitive metrics. This proactive monitoring can detect exploitation attempts in real-time.
6. **Developer Education:** Provide comprehensive security training to developers on the risks associated with exposing diagnostic endpoints and the importance of secure-by-default configurations. Emphasize the conflict between broad observability and the principle of least privilege in a production context.
7. **Automated Security Scans:** Integrate automated security testing tools into the CI/CD pipeline that can detect exposed endpoints and sensitive data in metrics. This includes static analysis tools (SAST) and dynamic analysis tools (DAST) that can simulate an attacker's reconnaissance.

## Summary

The "Leaky Metrics Endpoints" vulnerability in Golang applications represents a significant security risk, primarily stemming from the insecure exposure of `/metrics` and `/debug/pprof` interfaces. This misconfiguration, often an oversight in deployment, transforms internal diagnostic tools into potent attack vectors for reconnaissance, sensitive data exfiltration (including credentials and internal network details), and denial-of-service attacks. The widespread prevalence of such exposures, as evidenced by hundreds of thousands of publicly accessible instances, underscores the critical need for immediate and comprehensive remediation.

The core problem is not a flaw in Go's language or libraries, but rather a failure to implement secure-by-default principles for these powerful diagnostic components. The ease of enabling these features without explicit security controls places the burden of protection entirely on the developer, leading to common mistakes such as absent authentication, public network exposure, and insufficient data filtering. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities can provide attackers with an invaluable initial foothold, facilitating lateral movement and escalating to broader system compromises.

Effective remediation requires a multi-layered defense strategy, including strict network segmentation, mandatory authentication for all diagnostic endpoints, rigorous sensitive data redaction from metrics, and careful, conditional activation of profiling tools in production. Furthermore, continuous monitoring, automated security testing, and robust developer education are essential to prevent future occurrences and maintain a strong security posture against this pervasive threat.
