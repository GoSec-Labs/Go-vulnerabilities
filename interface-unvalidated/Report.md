### Vulnerability Title

Unvalidated `interface{}` Usage (interface-unvalidated)

### Severity Rating

MediumðŸŸ¡ to HighðŸŸ  (The severity depends heavily on how the unvalidated data is subsequently used. If it leads to arbitrary code execution or data corruption, it's High. If it leads to crashes or information disclosure, it might be Medium.)

### Description

This vulnerability occurs when a Go program receives an `interface{}` (or its alias `any`) value, performs a type assertion or type switch on it, and then uses the asserted concrete type without sufficient validation of its content or structure. If the `interface{}` value originates from an untrusted source (e.g., network input, deserialized data, configuration files), an attacker could craft a malicious input that passes the type assertion but contains unexpected or malformed data within that type, leading to unexpected program behavior, crashes, or security bypasses.

### Technical Description (for security pros)

In Go, `interface{}` (or `any`) can hold any value of any type. When such a value is received, typically from external input (JSON/YAML deserialization, RPC calls, command-line arguments, user input), a common pattern is to use a [type assertion](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://go.dev/ref/spec%23Type_assertions) (`x.(T)`) or a [type switch](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://go.dev/ref/spec%23Type_switches) (`switch v := x.(type)`) to determine and extract the underlying concrete type.

The vulnerability arises when the developer performs the type assertion *but fails to adequately validate the structure or content of the concrete type once it's extracted*. For example:

1.  **Direct Type Assertion (without `ok` check):** `val := input.(MyStruct)`
      * If `input` is not `MyStruct`, this will cause a `panic`. An attacker can induce a Denial of Service by sending an unexpected type.
2.  **Type Assertion with `ok` check, but no subsequent content validation:**
    ```go
    if myStructVal, ok := input.(MyStruct); ok {
        // Assume myStructVal is always valid and safe to use
        // without checking its internal fields or values.
        // E.g., if MyStruct contains a file path, or an SQL query fragment.
        process(myStructVal)
    }
    ```
      * Even if the type is correct (`MyStruct`), an attacker might provide a `MyStruct` instance with malicious data in its fields (e.g., an arbitrary file path for a file operation, a malicious URL for an HTTP client, or an injection string for a database query).
3.  **Type Switch with inadequate handling of cases:**
    ```go
    switch v := input.(type) {
    case MyStruct:
        // Process MyStruct, but fields might be malicious.
        process(v)
    case AnotherStruct:
        // Process AnotherStruct, but fields might be malicious.
        processAnother(v)
    default:
        // Panic or log, but the vulnerability isn't in this branch,
        // rather in the unvalidated use of v in the other branches.
    }
    ```
      * The type switch correctly handles different types, but the *subsequent processing* within each `case` block does not validate the content of the typed value `v`.

This flaw is particularly dangerous when the `interface{}` value represents deserialized data, as deserialization vulnerabilities often stem from applications trusting the structure and content of deserialized objects without proper validation.

### Common Mistakes That Cause This

  * **Trusting Deserialized Data:** Assuming that data deserialized from external sources into a Go struct (e.g., JSON, YAML, protobuf) is inherently safe once it's been type-asserted.
  * **Missing `ok` check in Type Assertions:** Using `value := i.(Type)` instead of `value, ok := i.(Type)` can lead to panics if the type doesn't match, resulting in Denial of Service.
  * **Lack of Deep Validation:** Validating only the top-level type but not recursively validating fields, especially for nested structs, slices, or maps within the asserted type.
  * **Assuming Internal Consistency:** Believing that data, once it conforms to a certain type, will also conform to internal business logic rules or safety constraints.
  * **Incomplete Type Switch Cases:** Not handling all expected types, or more critically, not validating the content *within* the handled types.
  * **Developer Oversight:** Overlooking the need for explicit content validation after type assertion, especially in complex data processing pipelines.

### Exploitation Goals

  * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Triggering panics by supplying an unexpected type (if no `ok` check is present), or by supplying malformed data that causes resource exhaustion or crashes in subsequent processing.
  * **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** If the data is used to construct dynamic code (e.g., in templating engines or command execution), malicious input could lead to ACE.
  * **Data Corruption/Manipulation:** Injecting invalid data into data structures, leading to incorrect calculations, corrupted state, or bypassing security checks.
  * **Information Disclosure:** Supplying data that causes the application to reveal sensitive information (e.g., error messages with stack traces, paths, or internal logic).
  * **SQL/NoSQL Injection:** If the asserted type's fields are directly incorporated into database queries without sanitization.
  * **Path Traversal/Arbitrary File Access:** If the asserted type's fields are used as file paths without proper validation.

### Affected Components or Files

Any Go code that:

  * Accepts `interface{}` (or `any`) as input to a function or method.
  * Performs type assertions (`.(Type)`) or type switches (`switch v := i.(type)`) on this `interface{}`.
  * Subsequently uses the extracted concrete value *without sufficient validation* of its internal fields or values, especially if the `interface{}` originates from an untrusted source.
  * Commonly found in API handlers, deserialization routines, message queue consumers, or configuration loaders.

### Vulnerable Code Snippet

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
)

// UserRequest represents a user-provided request structure
type UserRequest struct {
	Action string
	Path   string
	Data   string
}

// processUntrustedInput receives an interface{} from an untrusted source
// and performs an unvalidated type assertion.
func processUntrustedInput(input interface{}) {
	// WARNING: Vulnerable code - no validation after type assertion
	req, ok := input.(UserRequest)
	if !ok {
		fmt.Println("Error: Input is not a UserRequest. Ignoring.")
		return
	}

	// Assume req is valid and safe to use, which is a mistake
	fmt.Printf("Processing request: Action='%s', Path='%s', Data='%s'\n", req.Action, req.Path, req.Data)

	if req.Action == "read_file" {
		// Vulnerable: Directly using req.Path without validation, allows path traversal
		content, err := ioutil.ReadFile(req.Path)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error reading file %s: %v\n", req.Path, err)
			return
		}
		fmt.Printf("File content for %s: %s\n", req.Path, string(content))
	} else if req.Action == "write_file" {
		// Vulnerable: Directly using req.Path and req.Data without validation
		err := ioutil.WriteFile(req.Path, []byte(req.Data), 0644)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error writing file %s: %v\n", req.Path, err)
			return
		}
		fmt.Printf("Successfully wrote to %s\n", req.Path)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("Unknown action: %s\n", req.Action)
	}
}

func main() {
	// Create a dummy file for demonstration
	_ = ioutil.WriteFile("secret.txt", []byte("This is a secret file."), 0644)

	// Attacker provides malicious input
	maliciousInput := UserRequest{
		Action: "read_file",
		Path:   "../../../../../../../../etc/passwd", // Path traversal attempt
	}
	fmt.Println("--- Attempting malicious read_file ---")
	processUntrustedInput(maliciousInput)

	maliciousWriteInput := UserRequest{
		Action: "write_file",
		Path:   "malicious_exec.sh",
		Data:   "#!/bin/bash\necho Hacked! > /tmp/hacked.txt",
	}
	fmt.Println("\n--- Attempting malicious write_file ---")
	processUntrustedInput(maliciousWriteInput)

	// Clean up dummy file
	_ = os.Remove("secret.txt")
	_ = os.Remove("malicious_exec.sh")
}
```

### Detection Steps

1.  **Code Review:** Manually inspect functions that accept `interface{}` as input, especially if they are exposed to external users (e.g., HTTP handlers, message consumers). Look for type assertions (`.(Type)`) or type switches (`switch v := i.(type)`) followed by operations on the asserted type's fields without explicit validation (e.g., checking string lengths, allowed characters, valid ranges, path sanitization).
2.  **Static Analysis (SAST):** Use SAST tools (e.g., Go's `govulncheck`, CodeQL, commercial SAST solutions) that can detect unvalidated inputs and data flow into dangerous sinks (file operations, command execution, database queries). While direct detection of "unvalidated `interface{}` usage" might be challenging for generic SAST tools, they can identify the downstream consequences.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis/Fuzzing:** Supply crafted malicious `interface{}` values (e.g., through JSON, YAML, or direct struct instantiation) to the application. Use fuzzing tools to generate various malformed inputs for the expected types to uncover crashes or unexpected behavior.
4.  **Security Linters:** Use linters that enforce strict input validation policies or highlight patterns of direct use of deserialized data.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

The "Vulnerable Code Snippet" above serves as a basic PoC.

To execute and observe the impact:

1.  Save the vulnerable code as `vulnerable.go`.
2.  Run `go run vulnerable.go`.

**Expected Output (on Unix-like systems):**

```
--- Attempting malicious read_file ---
Processing request: Action='read_file', Path='../../../../../../../../etc/passwd', Data=''
File content for ../../../../../../../../etc/passwd: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
... (contents of /etc/passwd) ...

--- Attempting malicious write_file ---
Processing request: Action='write_file', Path='malicious_exec.sh', Data='#!/bin/bash
echo Hacked! > /tmp/hacked.txt'
Successfully wrote to malicious_exec.sh
```

This demonstrates how an attacker can read system files (Path Traversal) and potentially write arbitrary files, which could then be executed if the system is configured to do so.

### Risk Classification

  * **Confidentiality:** High (e.g., sensitive file disclosure via path traversal).
  * **Integrity:** High (e.g., writing arbitrary files, data manipulation).
  * **Availability:** Medium (e.g., DoS via panics or resource exhaustion from malformed data).
  * **CVSS:** Ranges from Medium to Critical, depending on the severity of the downstream impact. If combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., arbitrary file write + execution), it can be Critical.
  * **CWE:** Often falls under:
      * CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
      * CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used in a Web Page (XSS)
      * CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (Command Injection)
      * CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (Path Traversal)
      * CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (if the `interface{}` originates from deserialization)

### Fix & Patch Guidance

The core fix is to perform robust validation on the *contents* of any type-asserted `interface{}` value, especially if it originates from an untrusted source.

1.  **Always use the "comma-ok" idiom for type assertions:**
    ```go
    value, ok := input.(ExpectedType)
    if !ok {
        // Handle unexpected type gracefully (e.g., return an error, log, ignore).
        return fmt.Errorf("unexpected type: %T", input)
    }
    // Proceed with validation of 'value'
    ```
2.  **Validate the content/fields of the asserted type:** After a successful type assertion, rigorously validate every field of the extracted struct, map, or slice:
      * **String fields:** Check for allowed characters, length limits, special characters (e.g., path separators, SQL quotes). Use string sanitization libraries.
      * **Numeric fields:** Check for ranges, positive/negative constraints.
      * **Paths:** Use `filepath.Clean` and restrict paths to an allowed directory (e.g., using `strings.HasPrefix` on the result of `filepath.Clean` against a base directory, and ensuring `.` or `..` are not present as components).
      * **URLs:** Parse and validate schemes, hosts, and paths.
      * **Complex types:** Recursively validate nested structs, map keys/values, and slice elements.
      * **Enum-like strings:** Ensure the string matches a predefined set of allowed values.
3.  **Implement `Validate()` methods:** For complex structs, define `Validate()` methods that encapsulate validation logic.
4.  **Use Schema Validation Libraries:** For deserialized data, consider using libraries that enforce schemas (e.g., JSON schema validation libraries) before processing the data.
5.  **Fail-safe:** If validation fails, reject the input, log the event, and return an appropriate error to the client.

**Example of Fixed Code:**

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
	"strings"
)

// UserRequest represents a user-provided request structure
type UserRequest struct {
	Action string
	Path   string
	Data   string
}

// Validate ensures the UserRequest fields are safe and valid.
func (ur UserRequest) Validate() error {
	if ur.Action == "" {
		return errors.New("action cannot be empty")
	}
	if ur.Action != "read_file" && ur.Action != "write_file" && ur.Action != "list_dir" { // Add more actions as needed
		return fmt.Errorf("unsupported action: %s", ur.Action)
	}

	if ur.Path != "" {
		// Sanitize and validate path to prevent path traversal
		cleanedPath := filepath.Clean(ur.Path)
		if strings.HasPrefix(cleanedPath, "..") || strings.HasPrefix(cleanedPath, "/") {
			// Prevent absolute paths or path traversal attempts
			return fmt.Errorf("invalid path: %s", ur.Path)
		}
		// Further restrict to a base directory if necessary (e.g., current directory)
		if !strings.HasPrefix(cleanedPath, "allowed_data/") && !strings.HasPrefix(cleanedPath, "safe_temp/") && cleanedPath != "secret.txt" {
			// This check is highly specific. A more robust solution involves creating a base directory
			// and ensuring all paths are relative to and confined within it.
			return fmt.Errorf("path '%s' is not in an allowed directory", ur.Path)
		}
		ur.Path = cleanedPath // Use the cleaned path
	}

	// Add more specific data validation based on the action
	if ur.Action == "write_file" && len(ur.Data) > 1024*10 { // Example: limit data size
		return errors.New("data too large for write_file action")
	}

	return nil
}

// processTrustedInput receives an interface{} after validation and safe handling.
func processTrustedInput(input interface{}) {
	req, ok := input.(UserRequest)
	if !ok {
		fmt.Printf("Error: Input is not a UserRequest. Actual type: %T. Ignoring.\n", input)
		return
	}

	// Perform content validation after type assertion
	if err := req.Validate(); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Validation error for UserRequest: %v. Ignoring.\n", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("Processing VALIDATED request: Action='%s', Path='%s', Data='%s'\n", req.Action, req.Path, req.Data)

	if req.Action == "read_file" {
		content, err := ioutil.ReadFile(req.Path)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error reading file %s: %v\n", req.Path, err)
			return
		}
		fmt.Printf("File content for %s: %s\n", req.Path, string(content))
	} else if req.Action == "write_file" {
		err := ioutil.WriteFile(req.Path, []byte(req.Data), 0644)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error writing file %s: %v\n", req.Path, err)
			return
		}
		fmt.Printf("Successfully wrote to %s\n", req.Path)
	} else {
		// This should theoretically not be reached if Validate() is robust
		fmt.Printf("Unknown action: %s\n", req.Action)
	}
}

func main() {
	// Create a dummy file for demonstration
	_ = ioutil.WriteFile("secret.txt", []byte("This is a secret file."), 0644)

	fmt.Println("--- Attempting malicious read_file (will be blocked) ---")
	maliciousInput := UserRequest{
		Action: "read_file",
		Path:   "../../../../../../../../etc/passwd", // Path traversal attempt
	}
	processTrustedInput(maliciousInput) // Will be blocked by validation

	fmt.Println("\n--- Attempting malicious write_file (will be blocked) ---")
	maliciousWriteInput := UserRequest{
		Action: "write_file",
		Path:   "malicious_exec.sh", // Path will be blocked by validation
		Data:   "#!/bin/bash\necho Hacked! > /tmp/hacked.txt",
	}
	processTrustedInput(maliciousWriteInput) // Will be blocked by validation

	fmt.Println("\n--- Attempting valid read_file ---")
	validInput := UserRequest{
		Action: "read_file",
		Path:   "secret.txt", // Valid path
	}
	processTrustedInput(validInput)

	// Clean up dummy file
	_ = os.Remove("secret.txt")
}
```

### Scope and Impact

The scope is broad, affecting any Go application that handles untrusted data through `interface{}` and then implicitly trusts the content of type-asserted values. This includes:

  * **Web Services/APIs:** Where JSON/XML/form data is deserialized into `interface{}` and then cast to specific structs.
  * **Command-Line Tools:** If arguments are parsed into `interface{}`.
  * **Configuration Parsers:** Loading configuration from untrusted sources.
  * **Message Queues:** Processing messages from external systems.
  * **Plugins/Dynamic Loading:** If external modules can pass `interface{}` values.

The impact can range from minor application errors to critical system compromise, depending on how the unvalidated data is subsequently used. It directly facilitates other common vulnerabilities like Path Traversal, SQL Injection, Command Injection, and logic flaws.

### Remediation Recommendation

  * **Strict Input Validation:** Implement comprehensive validation for all input data, especially data originating from untrusted sources. This validation must occur *after* type assertion but *before* the data is used in any security-sensitive operation (file I/O, database queries, command execution, network requests).
  * **Use `comma-ok` idiom or `type switch`:** Always handle the case where a type assertion fails to prevent panics and ensure graceful error handling.
  * **`Validate()` Methods for Structs:** Encapsulate validation logic within `Validate()` methods on relevant structs to ensure consistency.
  * **Dedicated Input DTOs:** Define specific Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for incoming requests and ensure all fields in these DTOs are validated.
  * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application only attempts operations with the minimum necessary permissions.
  * **Security Libraries:** Utilize libraries for input validation, sanitization, and handling of sensitive operations (e.g., safe path handling).

### Summary

The "Unvalidated `interface{}` Usage" vulnerability in Go occurs when `interface{}` (or `any`) values, typically from untrusted inputs, are type-asserted or type-switched without subsequent validation of their underlying concrete data. This means that while the *type* might be correct, the *content* of the data within that type could be malicious. This can lead to various attacks, including Denial of Service, path traversal, SQL injection, or command injection. The primary remediation is to implement rigorous content validation on all fields of a type-asserted value before it's used in any sensitive operation. This often involves defining explicit validation rules or `Validate()` methods on data structures and always handling type assertion failures gracefully.
