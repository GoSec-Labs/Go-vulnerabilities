# Vulnerability Title: 
Corrupted and Undefined Behavior in EVM Transactions

## Severity Rating
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: High
- **Category**: Implementation Error

## Description
This vulnerability arises when EVM transactions exhibit corrupted calldata or undefined behavior during execution. While the transaction may appear valid on the surface, inconsistencies between the intended logic and the actual contract state are introduced. This affects the reliability of state transitions and can mislead users, developers, or auditors relying on transaction data.

## Technical Description (for security pros)
Under certain conditions, a transaction sent to a smart contract can result in corrupted calldata or misinterpreted input, leading to unexpected contract behavior or incorrect state changes. This behavior is not limited to a specific Solidity version or EVM implementation, suggesting the root cause may lie in the transaction propagation, ABI encoding/decoding, or client-side tooling. Even trivial functions (e.g., incrementing a counter) are affected. The issue is reproducible and visible when inspecting calldata or contract storage after execution, indicating a deeper fault in the transaction handling process.

### **9. Vulnerable Code Snippet**

This is a minimal example of a contract that may seem safe but is susceptible when malformed calldata is submitted:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public count;

    function increment() public {
        count += 1;
    }
}
```

When `increment()` is called using incorrectly encoded or manually corrupted calldata, the function may not execute as expected, and the state (`count`) remains unchanged or is unpredictably modified.



### **10. Detection Steps**

| Step                              | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Deploy**                     | Deploy a minimal contract with a public setter or counter function (like `increment()`).          |
| **2. Prepare Malformed Calldata** | Manually encode a transaction using raw calldata (e.g., function selector with padding or noise). |
| **3. Send Transaction**           | Submit the transaction using a low-level RPC method (`eth_sendRawTransaction`).                   |
| **4. Observe Behavior**           | Compare expected output (e.g., `count == 1`) with actual contract state.                          |
| **5. Inspect Calldata**           | Use block explorers or CLI tools to decode the input and observe anomalies.                       |

You can use tools like [Etherscan Calldata Decoder](https://etherscan.io/tx-decoder) or CLI tools like `cast calldata-decode` from Foundry to analyze calldata inconsistencies.


### **10. Proof of Concept (PoC)**

#### Malformed Calldata Example:

```json
{
  "to": "0xYourContractAddress",
  "data": "0xd09de08affff0000" // increment() selector + corrupted padding
}
```

#### Outcome:

* Transaction is confirmed.
* Contract state (`count`) is not updated or shows incorrect value.
* Calldata decoded from the transaction does not match ABI-expected format.
* Repeated attempts show inconsistent state results — behavior becomes undefined.

#### PoC Tools:

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Foundry**                     | `cast send`, `cast calldata-decode`            |
| **web3.js or ethers.js**        | Custom scripts to send raw transactions        |
| **Hardhat/Ethers**              | Build fuzzing scenarios using custom ABI input |
| **EVM Tracer (Tenderly/Anvil)** | Inspect execution trace and input logs         |

### **12. Fix & Patch Guidance**

| Action                               | Recommendation                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input Validation**                 | Add internal guards to validate calldata structure and length where applicable.                         |
| **Use Strict ABI Calls**             | Avoid relying on raw calldata decoding or unchecked low-level `call` operations.                        |
| **Proxy Safety**                     | Ensure fallback functions in proxies include checks on `msg.sig` and `msg.data`.                        |
| **Harden Clients**                   | Enforce stricter ABI encoding in frontend/backend libraries; avoid raw transaction usage in production. |
| **Test Against Calldata Corruption** | Implement fuzzing or property-based testing using tools like Echidna or Foundry’s fuzzing framework.    |


### **13. Scope and Impact**

This vulnerability affects any system relying on the correct transmission, decoding, and execution of transaction calldata. It spans:

* Ethereum L1
* L2 solutions (Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync)
* Custom rollups
* Smart contracts using fallback/low-level calls
* Proxy contract-based upgradable patterns

### Potential Impact:

* Unexpected contract state
* Fund mismanagement or loss
* Broken application logic
* Mistrust in dApp execution

Even basic contract functions may become unreliable in the presence of malformed input, undermining the determinism expected in blockchain systems.


### **14. Remediation Recommendation**

* Always validate the calldata length and structure when using fallback or low-level functions.
* Avoid sending manually crafted transactions in production unless fully verified.
* Normalize your frontend/backend tooling around one trusted ABI encoder/decoder (e.g., ethers.js with explicit types).
* Upgrade proxy contracts to use transparent patterns that forward only verified calls.
* Set up automated tests to run malformed calldata inputs against contract interfaces during CI/CD.


### **15. Summary**

The vulnerability titled **“Corrupted and Undefined Behavior in EVM Transactions”** stems from improper calldata handling at the boundary between off-chain systems and EVM execution. It leads to unpredictable state transitions, silently failing functions, or inconsistent contract behavior. Though subtle, it poses a critical risk, especially in high-stakes systems like DeFi protocols and DAO infrastructures. The fix lies in rigorous input validation, ABI conformity, and thorough testing across multiple transaction paths.
