# Vulnerability Title: 
Corrupted and Undefined Behavior in EVM Transactions

## Severity Rating
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: High
- **Category**: Implementation Error

## Description
This vulnerability arises when EVM transactions exhibit corrupted calldata or undefined behavior during execution. While the transaction may appear valid on the surface, inconsistencies between the intended logic and the actual contract state are introduced. This affects the reliability of state transitions and can mislead users, developers, or auditors relying on transaction data.

## Technical Description (for security pros)
Under certain conditions, a transaction sent to a smart contract can result in corrupted calldata or misinterpreted input, leading to unexpected contract behavior or incorrect state changes. This behavior is not limited to a specific Solidity version or EVM implementation, suggesting the root cause may lie in the transaction propagation, ABI encoding/decoding, or client-side tooling. Even trivial functions (e.g., incrementing a counter) are affected. The issue is reproducible and visible when inspecting calldata or contract storage after execution, indicating a deeper fault in the transaction handling process.
